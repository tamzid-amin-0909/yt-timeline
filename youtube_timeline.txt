04:18 - toast see she could get away with this
04:21 - if she's really hot like this kind of
04:23 - behavior you can totally get through
04:26 - life as a hot woman and be super
04:28 - successful with that kind of behavior
04:29 - havior but you got to be really hot to
04:31 - pull off that attitude I think we need
04:33 - like a like a really hot Avatar how yeah
04:36 - very hot how long before we have an
04:39 - actual sex robot that can talk to you
04:41 - like that uh probably not long not that
04:44 - long right no I mean less than five

04:53 - can have a CAC go if you want yeah you
04:55 - probably could right probably a furry um
04:58 - yeah you could have a furry lady that
04:59 - you have sex with yeah like an avatar
05:01 - lady maybe a big giant blue lady that
05:02 - lives in your house yeah you know whoa
05:06 - whoa with the tail yeah the whole tail

05:13 - they they link up they share souls okay
05:16 - something like that you know people got
05:18 - you remember Avatar Depression was like
05:21 - a legitimate psychological or the no
05:25 - after Avatar people got depressed cuz
05:27 - they wanted to live on that [ __ ]
05:29 - planet with those blue people and live
05:31 - free they live pure yeah I didn't hear
05:34 - about this yeah Avatar depression it was
05:35 - like a real thing people were talking to
05:37 - their therapist so much about being
05:40 - depressed mode too we try that what's
05:42 - that depressed mode no don't do
05:46 - it that I think there is yeah we've got
05:48 - like
05:50 - um we've got unlicensed therapist as a
05:54 - when we were talking um when we ran into
05:57 - each other at the church at the
05:58 - inauguration you were telling me that
06:00 - this is getting better and better so
06:02 - quickly that it's astonishing hey
06:06 - ARA hey Alon how's it going today good
06:10 - can you tell me about Avatar depression
06:13 - like if you see the movie Avatar but you
06:14 - can't live there so you get
06:17 - sad that's an interesting concept have
06:19 - you ever experienced feeling so
06:21 - connected to a place or community that
06:24 - the thought of leaving made you feel
06:25 - deeply sad so is this the depressed
06:28 - voice this is the therapist oh this is a
06:34 - therapist what are some ways you think
06:36 - you could cope with that kind of sadness
06:38 - if it happened to you I don't have that
06:40 - kind of sadness honestly
06:42 - I you I thought the movie would had some
06:44 - good special effects but I did not want
06:46 - to live on the
06:48 - planet this is just coming from a guy
06:50 - who wants to go to Mars yeah yeah um oh
06:54 - speaking of Mars what do you think about
06:56 - that crazy square that structure I guess
06:59 - there are sort of squarish things on
07:01 - Earth you know planet's a big place so
07:03 - yeah but that one eventually it's going
07:05 - to be pretty Square no it's it's alien
07:08 - civilizations of course that's what I
07:10 - think yeah yeah I mean what is it sorry
07:13 - course if you if an alien civilization
07:15 - did exist though and it you know what
07:17 - happened got hit by an asteroid whatever
07:19 - fting thought oh she won want ask she's
07:22 - like the hot lady at the party that
07:23 - interrupts the conversation so if if
07:26 - that was the case like that thing that's
07:28 - pretty shocking like especially
07:30 - ancient ruins you look at like what it
07:32 - looks like when they they highlight the
07:33 - actual structure of it it looks like
07:35 - ancient ruins and if you had ruins of
07:38 - something made of stone and it got hit
07:40 - by an asteroid millions and millions and
07:42 - millions of years ago who knows what it
07:43 - would look like right now that just
07:45 - looks oddly created looks oddly
07:48 - manufactured well i' probably well maybe
07:51 - we should go there and check it out yeah
07:54 - and see what it's like is there um ways
07:57 - that we can get better photographs it
07:58 - seems like that's a pretty good
07:59 - photograph
08:01 - though yeah I mean my view is we should
08:03 - move to Mars well not move to Mars we
08:05 - should have a second planet uh to
08:07 - preserve civilization right um because
08:10 - let's say hypothetically I mean maybe
08:11 - that maybe those are the ruins of a long
08:14 - dead civilization um that will probably
08:16 - happen to Earth at some point you know
08:18 - it's a matter of time before uh we get
08:21 - hit by an asteroid
08:23 - or uh maybe we do we annihilate
08:27 - ourselves with nuclear war or super
08:30 - volcanoes or super volcanoes exactly
08:33 - yeah there's a lot of things that could
08:34 - happen to us it's not a bad idea to
08:36 - hedge your PS yeah yeah uh genetically
08:39 - engineered super
08:41 - virus
08:43 - yeah this episode is brought to you by
08:46 - LifeLock tax season is already stressful

08:51 - identity theft on top of everything else

08:58 - info does a lot of traveling to places
09:00 - you can't control it goes through
09:02 - payroll your accountant or your tax
09:05 - consultant and countless other data
09:07 - centers on its way to the IRS any of
09:10 - them can expose you to identity theft
09:12 - because they all have the info on your
09:14 - W2 just the ticket for criminals to
09:17 - steal your identity it's no wonder last
09:20 - year the IRS reported tax fraud due to

10:10 - didn't shut them down no the Wuhan lab
10:11 - was they were just talking about one
10:12 - that has a 30% fatality rate that
10:14 - they're working on yeah uh why are we
10:16 - doing that yeah for what reason you did
10:19 - it for so many years and you didn't have
10:20 - a cure what could possibly go wrong also
10:22 - wouldn't be the reason to do that so you
10:24 - could develop a cure at the same time
10:27 - and clearly you didn't have a cure so
10:29 - this is really foolish and
10:33 - bizarre yeah um I think we should stop
10:36 - stop trying to genetically engineer
10:37 - super viruses it's insane I mean when
10:41 - you're going through all this USA stuff
10:43 - yeah like here's what's weird first of
10:46 - all what is it like to buy a company for
10:48 - $44 billion and then people call you a
10:50 - Nazi on that same thing that you bought
10:53 - I did not see it
10:57 - coming it's like it's classic
11:01 - people will gobl anything down
11:04 - yeah oh he's never going to stop wa wait
11:06 - what um what is it like like all the
11:09 - people used to the left was in love with
11:11 - you and now the same idiots are calling
11:14 - you a Nazi it's the most bizarre thing
11:17 - I've ever seen in my life um I mean
11:19 - there's so many examples of people
11:21 - saying my heart goes out to you you did
11:23 - it with a little enthusiasm that
11:24 - probably wouldn't be recommended with
11:26 - hindsight yes but there's obviously um
11:29 - me in the most positive spirit possible
11:31 - yes obviously obvious but it's so
11:34 - strange where people want to think that
11:35 - you are openly public publicly doing
11:39 - Secret Nazi sey hand motions and now I
11:43 - can never point at things diagonally I
11:44 - can only point at things there and there
11:47 - and then I say you have to divide that
11:49 - yeah because that's where the spaceship
11:51 - is over there it's ridiculous it's
11:53 - ridiculous when um CNN when I was in all
11:57 - my trouble absur every time CNN used a
11:59 - photo of me it was one of the photos
12:00 - from the UFC weigh-ins where I go like
12:02 - this welcome to the weigh-ins so every
12:04 - photo was
12:06 - me every photo was me with it's it's so
12:09 - crazy it's delate propaganda so they
12:12 - they they know it was not it was
12:14 - obviously not meant uh it in a negative
12:17 - way that it was that I literally said my
12:18 - heart goes out to you and it was very
12:20 - positive the entire speech was incre
12:22 - very positive uh I was being very
12:24 - enthusiastic about the future in space
12:27 - um and the you know
12:29 - um the the was a great crowd you know so
12:34 - he got a little pumped up yeah it got
12:36 - pumped up exactly yeah that's all it is
12:38 - obviously obviously obviously there's
12:39 - video of Tim wals doing the exact same
12:42 - thing doing the exact same thing right
12:46 - exact same thing and he said of course
12:48 - it's a Nazi salute he said that right
12:50 - right this is how crazy things have
12:52 - gotten like well it's I mean it's it's
12:55 - coordinated propaganda so um the
13:00 - you know it's yeah coordinated
13:02 - propaganda the I mean doesn't it seem
13:04 - weird that the Legacy Media all says the
13:06 - same thing they all say the same thing
13:08 - at the same time using the same phrases
13:10 - they they barely even they don't even
13:11 - bother picking up a thesaurus right so
13:15 - uh like right before um you know the the
13:19 - debate between Biden and Trump Shar
13:21 - everyone was saying sharp is like who
13:23 - says shop is attack but yeah exactly you
13:26 - know it's like it's not a common phrase
13:28 - it's definitely not to be repeated on
13:30 - air with multiple people simultaneously
13:33 - that's weird yes that's
13:36 - coordinated 100% 100% yes yeah like
13:39 - hundreds of people saying it
13:41 - simultaneously uh they just got their
13:43 - instructions yeah so I mean essentially
13:47 - the um you know the the Dem leadership
13:50 - or you know political leadership did
13:52 - they issue their instructions and their
13:54 - puppets carry it out yeah and they're
13:56 - just like puppets in a puppet show and
13:59 - that's the problem that I see with all
14:02 - this Doge stuff because everybody should
14:05 - be celebrating that we've found a way to
14:09 - cut out fraud and waste yeah if you pay
14:11 - taxes and you don't like that you have
14:13 - to pay so much in taxes and then you
14:17 - find out that there's significant fraud
14:19 - and waste that's been exposed you should
14:22 - be celebrating it this shouldn't be oh
14:25 - no the wrong people found this fact and
14:29 - now it's a bad thing yes and then
14:32 - there's the [ __ ] propaganda the mind
14:35 - [ __ ] of calling it us Aid instead of the
14:38 - United States agency for International
14:40 - Development it sounds like it's feeding
14:42 - hungry people where people are going to
14:44 - starve Elon this is horrible and then
14:46 - you find out actually it's like $250
14:50 - million for transgender animal
14:53 - studies literally mutilating animals yes
14:56 - mutilating animals in demented uh
14:59 - studies yes uh that are like the like
15:02 - the worst thing you could possibly
15:03 - imagine from a horror show the Beagle
15:04 - one the beagle puppy one hor where they
15:07 - they covered their head in a basket and
15:09 - put fleas on their head so they eat them
15:11 - alive yeah and then they studied these
15:12 - beagles and then killed them like what
15:14 - do you going to learn from that that's
15:16 - good for anybody yeah this some some
15:20 - really some psychotic stuff that happens
15:22 - so
15:24 - um yeah I mean the
15:29 - I guess
15:30 - uh the the the real threat here is to
15:34 - the bureaucracy so um like you probably
15:39 - saw like you know let's say like Trump
15:41 - is a threat to our democracy which is
15:43 - ironic since he was elected with a
15:45 - majority of the you know popular vote um
15:49 - they they started saying I was a threat
15:50 - to democracy but if you if you just
15:52 - replace threat to democracy with threat
15:54 - to bureaucracy it makes total sense
15:58 - right so
16:00 - um I mean the reality is that our
16:03 - elected officials have very very little
16:08 - power relative to the bureaucracy until
16:12 - Doge so doge is a threat to the
16:15 - bureaucracy it's the first threat to the
16:17 - bureaucracy normally the bureaucracy
16:19 - eats revolutions for breakfast this is
16:22 - the first time that they're not that the
16:25 - revolution might actually succeed that
16:27 - we could restore power to the people
16:30 - instead of power to the
16:31 - bureaucracy now the size of it yeah was
16:35 - when you guys first started
16:37 - investigating it when you first get in
16:41 - how much of it was shocking like this
16:43 - just the size of it all well the size of
16:46 - it all the small decisions result in
16:49 - multi-billion dollar
16:50 - outcomes uh so you know we'd see there
16:53 - was a case where we saw uh one person
16:56 - was getting $1.9 billion was sent to
16:59 - their NGO which basically got formed
17:01 - about a year ago and had no prior
17:05 - uh really no prior activity so they just
17:08 - stand up a you know an NGO the these the
17:11 - whole NGO thing is a is a nightmare um
17:15 - and it's it's a misnomer because if you
17:17 - have a govern funded non-governmental
17:19 - organization you're you're simply a
17:21 - govern funded organization it it it's a
17:24 - it's an oxymoron right it's a loophole
17:26 - yes it it basically the un funded NOS
17:30 - are a way to do things uh that would be
17:32 - illegal if they were the government but
17:34 - are somehow made legal if it's sent to a
17:38 - so-called
17:40 - nonprofit but these but these nonprofits
17:43 - are then used to people Cash Out These
17:45 - nonprofits they become very wealthy
17:47 - through nonprofits they pay themselves
17:50 - enormous sums through these
17:52 - nonprofits that's it's so insane that
17:55 - that's been going on for so long it's a
17:57 - gigantic scam like one of the biggest
17:59 - maybe the biggest scam ever and how many
18:03 - NOS uh I think there a total number of
18:07 - ngos probably Millions but uh in terms
18:08 - of large
18:10 - NOS tens of
18:13 - thousands uh I mean it's it's actually
18:16 - it's it's it's kind of a a hack to the
18:18 - system where you know someone can get an
18:21 - NGO stood up for for a fairly small
18:24 - amount of money like George sorus was
18:25 - really good at this like he really
18:27 - George sorus is like a assist hacker
18:29 - like he figured out how to hack the
18:30 - system he's a genius at Arbitrage um I
18:34 - mean these days he's he's pretty old but
18:37 - a genius at Arbitrage so he he figured
18:39 - out that you could leverage a small
18:40 - amount of money to create a
18:43 - nonprofit uh then Lobby the the
18:46 - politicians to send a ton of money to
18:48 - that nonprofit so you can take what
18:50 - might be you know uh a $10 million
18:54 - donation to a nonprofit to create a
18:56 - nonprofit and leverage that into a
18:57 - billion dollar non
18:59 - NGO nonprofit is a weird word it's just
19:01 - a non-governmental
19:03 - organization um and and then you can the
19:06 - government continues to fund that every
19:08 - year um and it'll have a nice sounding
19:10 - name like the institute for peace or
19:12 - something like that um but really it's a
19:15 - graft
19:16 - machine and what are their requirements
19:18 - with that money what do they have to do
19:21 - just really no requirements at all so
19:23 - they just get grants and the government
19:25 - just assumes that they're doing good
19:27 - work I think a lot of people in the
19:29 - government know that they are not doing
19:30 - good work uh but they it's a giant graft
19:35 - machine
19:37 - um I
19:39 - mean people online are like unpacking
19:41 - this you know um it almost seems fake
19:46 - like when you're seeing how we were we
19:47 - were covering this article that said
19:49 - 55,000 Democrat NOS were discovered that
19:52 - had been contributing to campaigns and
19:54 - moving things around and doing pushing
19:56 - propaganda and they were all connected
19:58 - they found it AI that you have to go
20:00 - through steps and steps and steps to
20:01 - figure out where the money's coming from
20:03 - oh it's all funneling down to this group
20:05 - and this group does
20:07 - that yeah it's a a giant propaganda
20:10 - machine a giant regime change machine
20:13 - yes yeah
20:15 - uh yes I mean but doesn't it does it do
20:18 - some good as well know it does some good
20:20 - so it's like there's it's not like 0%
20:23 - good uh if it was it's if it was like if
20:27 - it was really 0% good it be much easier
20:29 - to attack so they there's going to be
20:31 - some percent good that they they add in
20:33 - there but it's like it might be 5% or
20:35 - 10% good but 90 95% not so is there a
20:39 - way to audit all this stuff and find out
20:43 - oh these people are actually just
20:44 - sending food to poor people these people
20:47 - are actually just helping people with
20:48 - water in third world countries is
20:51 - there's a way to do that and keep
20:52 - funding those uh yeah I mean we we have
20:55 - continued to fund things that appear to
20:57 - be legitimate even with the flimsiest if
20:59 - if there's even the flimsiest excuse
21:01 - like I just say like send me a picture
21:03 - of the thing like you could literally
21:05 - have ai generate the picture but if
21:06 - you're not even willing to try to trick
21:09 - me then we're like not going to send the
21:11 - money okay so what restrictions were put
21:14 - on was there was some uh something set
21:17 - aside like medicine and there there's
21:20 - what was what was set aside that there
21:22 - was there like work for like Ebola
21:24 - prevention I I actually don't just know
21:26 - if this work is even effective uh it may
21:28 - may not be like it could be the kind of
21:30 - thing where you you sort of fund Ebola
21:31 - prevention but it turns out that
21:33 - actually you're funding a lab that
21:34 - develops new Ebola vir you know recipes
21:37 - or something you know yeah uh and they
21:39 - they claim it's Ebola prevention but
21:41 - it's actually Ebola creation so some of
21:42 - these things I I don't know I mean
21:45 - just um but it just seems like we you
21:48 - know we shouldn't be sending taxpayer
21:50 - money to dubious Enterprises overseas
21:53 - right yeah yeah and why are we doing it
21:55 - like what exactly is the reason is it
21:57 - because we want to make friends with
21:58 - these people so the Chinese don't take
22:00 - over the Russians don't take over okay
22:02 - how much of that is like a good thing
22:03 - how much of that is smart to do and how
22:06 - much is a grift and without any sort of
22:09 - oversight which has really been going on
22:10 - for so long they've just had Free Run
22:14 - yeah well it also we just have a real
22:16 - issue with the the the budget deficit
22:19 - it's gigantic so um like if you know all
22:24 - things being equal if if we didn't have
22:26 - a gigantic budget deficit uh where
22:28 - interest payments uh the interest on the
22:31 - national debt exceeds the defense
22:33 - department budget uh which is truly
22:35 - astounding which mean so we're paying
22:37 - over a trillion dollars of interest on
22:39 - the national debt um then okay would
22:42 - have more room for wasting money
22:44 - basically um but when uh when we're
22:48 - spending so much money that the company
22:49 - that the country is going bankrupt uh
22:51 - then we really need to stop stop
22:53 - spending money if uh unless we're sure
22:56 - it is good value so essentially we're
22:58 - like a poorly managed business with an
23:00 - unlimited credit line that is off the
23:02 - rails absolutely and if you were a
23:06 - person like you are who comes in and
23:08 - takes over businesses and straightens
23:09 - them out that's exactly what you're
23:11 - doing I mean most of the time I create
23:13 - businesses from scratch like Twitter was
23:15 - a case where you know I kind of bought a
23:18 - company that was I kind of knew it was a
23:19 - hair bow well you came in Tesla in the
23:21 - beginning but they were already doing
23:23 - something right no Tesla did Tesla did
23:25 - not exist in any meaningful form that it
23:27 - was there were no
23:29 - employees uh JV St and out joined three
23:32 - other people there was no car there was
23:34 - no
23:35 - nothing so wasn't even a prototype yet
23:38 - no oh okay I thought there was a
23:41 - prototype already no there weren't even
23:44 - any employees
23:46 - oh wasn't a f that's a funny narrative
23:48 - that people like to say that you didn't
23:49 - even create Tesla then yeah that's
23:51 - [Laughter]
23:55 - wrong so if you're handling the Govern
23:58 - government like a business you're going
24:00 - to have to go through all of these
24:03 - departments and do the exact same thing
24:05 - that you're doing with USA so how do how
24:07 - do you how does that scale up like how
24:10 - many people do you need to do something
24:11 - like
24:15 - that well we started off with about 40
24:18 - people u i maybe 100 people um and
24:23 - really just going through doing very
24:25 - basic things here uh it's uh as bad as
24:29 - Twitter was the federal government is
24:31 - much worse so
24:36 - um you know in the case of Twitter it
24:38 - wasn't a profitable company it was like
24:41 - basically a break even company but at
24:42 - least it was break even and it had to
24:44 - pass an audit the the federal government
24:47 - is not break even uh it's literally
24:49 - losing $2 trillion a year um and it does
24:52 - not pass its audits it fails its own
24:54 - audits so like you know there's a case
24:57 - where
24:59 - um like I think Senator Collins was
25:01 - telling me about how she she gave the
25:03 - Navy $12 billion for more submarines got
25:06 - no extra submarines um and then held a
25:09 - hearing to say where' the1 12 billion go
25:11 - and they were like we don't
25:13 - know that was
25:16 - it uh I mean the basically stuff is so
25:19 - crazy it's like only the federal
25:21 - government could get away with this
25:22 - level of waste of of waste it's mostly
25:26 - waste it's mostly not for it's mostly
25:27 - waste it's it's mostly just ridiculous
25:30 - things happening um because they've been
25:32 - able to do it this way for so long and
25:34 - they' become accustomed to
25:36 - it yeah I mean it's like Milton Friedman
25:38 - said like money is most poorly spent
25:41 - when when you're spending someone else's
25:43 - money on people you don't know how much
25:47 - are you going to care right and that's
25:49 - the that's the federal
25:51 - government so they they're spending
25:54 - someone else's money on people they
25:55 - don't know now imagine any other
25:58 - business that was this badly run that
26:02 - complains when you want to check the
26:05 - books and audit it and go through all
26:07 - the decisions that have been made and go
26:09 - through all the ledgers and like yeah
26:11 - what did you do well the people
26:13 - receiving the money uh want to keep
26:15 - receiving the money yeah yeah yeah
26:18 - clearly yes
26:20 - so but you
26:23 - know I mean the reason
26:26 - I'm the reason I'm uh
26:29 - putting so much effort into this is that
26:30 - I think it is a very dire situation it's
26:33 - not a you know
26:36 - um it's not optional basically so
26:43 - um yeah yeah America's going bankrupt so
26:47 - that that that just can't happen it's
26:49 - just bizarre to me that that some people
26:51 - aren't willing to look at it correctly
26:53 - they they're not willing to see like how
26:55 - much chaos this is how much waste and
26:56 - fraud there is how
26:59 - much how much could be trimmed and how
27:02 - just because people have jobs doing
27:04 - [ __ ] doesn't mean your tax dollar
27:06 - should pay for this [ __ ] yes um I
27:10 - mean we found just with a a basic sear
27:12 - of the Social Security database that
27:14 - there were um 20 million dead people
27:17 - mocked as alive but were they getting
27:20 - money some of them are getting money
27:22 - what percentage of them
27:25 - uh it isn't clear we're actually trying
27:27 - to run the I was trying to get an answer
27:29 - right before the show um what it looks
27:32 - like is that most of the fraud is not
27:34 - coming from Social Security payments
27:37 - directly but because they are marked as
27:39 - alive in the Social Security database
27:41 - that they can get then get disability
27:43 - Unemployment uh sort of fake medical
27:46 - payments and other things because
27:47 - they're marked as alive uh in the Social
27:49 - Security database so it looks like it's
27:52 - a bank the the the fraud is a bankshot
27:54 - essentially the they bankshot uh into uh
27:58 - Social Security uh they just do an areu
28:01 - alive check and then uh get fraudulent
28:05 - payments from every other part of the
28:07 - government oh yeah and and this exploits
28:11 - the the the fundamental weakness in the
28:13 - government is that the various govern
28:14 - databases they don't talk to each other
28:17 - or they they talk to each other very
28:18 - poorly in a very limited way so the way
28:21 - to the way that the system gets
28:22 - exploited is is by taking advantage of
28:25 - the the the poor communication between
28:28 - the various databases in the
28:30 - government um to give you an example of
28:33 - like what's happening in sayate uh
28:35 - treasury which is improving rapidly um
28:38 - the the main uh payments computer is
28:41 - called Pam uh like payments account
28:43 - payment accounts Master database or
28:45 - something like that but everyone calls a
28:46 - Pam um that's responsible for almost $5
28:49 - trillion payments a year roughly a
28:51 - billion dollar an hour and um when we
28:55 - came there we're looking at this payment
28:56 - it's like the the payments have no
28:59 - uh you could put a payment through with
29:02 - with no payment categorization code and
29:05 - and no description on the payment like
29:07 - basically untraceable blank
29:09 - checks um this is the kind of thing that
29:12 - if if it was done as a public company uh
29:15 - the company would uh be immediately
29:17 - delisted and the uh executive team would
29:20 - be thrown in prison but this is just
29:22 - normal at the government so we said okay
29:26 - our recommendation to the treasury and
29:28 - the Federal Reserve was like we need to
29:30 - make the the payment categorization
29:32 - codes mandatory not optional and you
29:36 - need there needs to be an ex an an
29:39 - explanation we're not judging the
29:40 - quality of the explanation but there
29:42 - should be some explanation for what this
29:44 - payment is for above
29:47 - nothing that's a radical change to the
29:50 - system that is being implemented now um
29:53 - I my guess is that probably saves a 100
29:55 - billion a year Jesus Christ
29:59 - that money going rough rough order
30:01 - magnitude where was that money
30:04 - going well so this is where you get into
30:07 - the the sort of gray boundary between
30:11 - waste and fraud um if money is sent to a
30:15 - person or or organization from the
30:17 - government
30:19 - um and you didn't really deserve it but
30:21 - the government still sent it to you is
30:23 - that waste or
30:25 - fraud right um
30:29 - so I mean there's a lot of payments that
30:31 - where someone just appr approved the
30:33 - payment but then that payment officer uh
30:36 - changed jobs or retired or died um and
30:40 - the payments just keep going you know
30:42 - it's like if you forget to pay your gym
30:44 - membership or something like that right
30:46 - now imagine it's not the gym membership
30:48 - you said your gym membership's $20
30:49 - billion a year or something you know um
30:53 - but they forgot to turn it
30:56 - off there like that happening at scale
30:59 - in the government Jesus it's totally
31:01 - nuts is what I'm saying so insane yes
31:04 - it's totally insane so what did you
31:07 - expect when you went in did you expect
31:09 - it would be like this I thought it's I
31:11 - thought it would be it would be bad but
31:12 - I did not think it would be as bad as
31:14 - this um I mean look the the good news is
31:19 - that uh it's a target-rich environment
31:21 - for saving
31:23 - money uh it's not like
31:26 - uh you it's not like if it it was a very
31:28 - well-run ship uh it was very efficient
31:32 - it would be hard to improve but it's not
31:34 - efficient so therefore it is
31:37 - actually relatively easy to improve
31:40 - let's just say it's not rocket science
31:42 - you know I know rocket science
31:45 - so it's a lot of uh mundane things um so
31:51 - and some of the some of the things are
31:52 - like so crazy that we didn't even know
31:54 - to ask about that because we just
31:57 - assumed umed like you know payments out
32:00 - of the treasury computer would have a
32:01 - payment categorization code and they
32:02 - would have some explanatory note saying
32:04 - what the payments for the idea that that
32:07 - it would be just untraceable blank
32:09 - checks uh didn't occur to us at
32:12 - first Jesus so anyway just this episode

33:29 - so is that one one of the things that
33:30 - accounts to there there's this
33:32 - 4 something trillion dollars that's kind
33:36 - of they don't know where it went they
33:39 - don't know that's a c I think that's
33:41 - probably a cumulative number um yes so
33:44 - yeah but yeah if you if you add
33:47 - up it's do you remember that story Jamie
33:50 - yeah what was the story almost what she
33:53 - said there like they just didn't have
33:54 - accounting for it I think yeah it was
33:56 - spent on legitimate things worry but we
33:58 - don't we don't know what we spent it
34:01 - on well I mean how do you know obviously
34:04 - one cannot say it's was spent
34:05 - legitimately if they don't know what it
34:06 - was spent on that doesn't make any sense
34:08 - this is this is such a fascinating time
34:12 - because with this setup the way it is
34:15 - right now with Trump back in after all
34:17 - that happened to him and with you there
34:20 - and with RFK Junior and Tulsi and cash
34:23 - Patel it's like this is a wild time to
34:27 - find out what really going on that's
34:28 - like never happened before this is
34:30 - nothing like the first term no like the
34:33 - first term he had a bunch of neocons in
34:35 - the cabinet and there's a bunch of shady
34:38 - people that he didn't know and he had to
34:40 - appoint all these different people maybe
34:42 - he got some bad picks now he's had four
34:45 - years to Stew on it right and with you
34:48 - guys all going through this we're
34:50 - getting an understanding of the
34:51 - government that we've literally never
34:53 - had before yeah this is a revolutionary
34:55 - cabinet and maybe the most re tionary
34:58 - cabinet since the the first
35:00 - Revolution uh this is this is not a
35:03 - bunch of business as
35:04 - usual uh types so this is why you know
35:08 - some of the the standard confirmations
35:10 - were quite challenging is because when
35:13 - you when you put to try to appoint
35:14 - people who are going to change the
35:16 - system yeah uh the system doesn't want
35:18 - to let them through but it's fascinating
35:21 - because it's like the vampires all out
35:23 - themselves like now everybody knows who
35:25 - the system is like if you're just lying
35:28 - about us and then they come and you talk
35:30 - on aast and expain what's like he's
35:34 - starving mothers there's mothers that
35:36 - can't get food totally false that's all
35:38 - you're hearing yeah that's that's no
35:40 - one's talking in any of these mainstream
35:42 - liberal talk shows no one is talking
35:46 - about all this fraud and waste yeah
35:48 - because we're cutting off their graph
35:49 - machine so that that's what they're
35:51 - upset about that's that's the real thing
35:53 - they're upset about U and if if if
35:55 - people want to know what uh do is
35:57 - cutting and and I want to be clear like
35:59 - these are cuts that Doge recommends to
36:01 - the department and usually these
36:03 - recommendations are followed but uh
36:06 - these are recommendations that are then
36:07 - confirmed by the department um the uh
36:11 - you can see line by line what do is done
36:14 - at Doge
36:15 - Dogo so what if we do we put on do. goov
36:19 - so you can see everything that is being
36:20 - done and there's a Tracker that shows is
36:22 - it how much money has been saved yeah
36:25 - yeah and you can look at each line item
36:27 - and and you know they like a bunch of
36:29 - these sort of sort of far left uh shows
36:32 - will will say like oh it's a
36:33 - constitutional crisis blah blah blah but
36:35 - what they won't do is point out which
36:36 - payments are wrong right so my challenge
36:39 - to them is point out which payments are
36:40 - wrong yeah go through it which which of
36:42 - which of these sort of waste fraud
36:45 - things are wrong which line explain that
36:48 - line to the public they won't be able to
36:51 - right yeah that's why you're not hearing
36:52 - any specifics you're hearing an stories
36:54 - about mothers we can name the specifics
36:57 - yeah
36:58 - line by line and we got the receipts and
37:00 - here's the other thing if you're post
37:02 - the receipts and if you're only talking
37:03 - about the propaganda talking points and
37:05 - you're not talking about the very clear
37:07 - fraud and waste it's very obvious what
37:09 - you're doing yeah you're just
37:11 - gaslighting yeah yeah totally yeah so
37:14 - exactly because we're say like look in
37:16 - fact I've said we're going to make
37:18 - mistakes we're not going to be perfect
37:20 - uh so if we make a mistake we'll quickly
37:23 - fix it so we'll we'll we'll you we need
37:27 - to act
37:28 - fast uh so stop wasting billions of
37:32 - dollars of taxpayer money um but if if
37:35 - we make a mistake we'll reverse it
37:37 - quickly right you know so it's also this
37:41 - interesting narrative that you shouldn't
37:43 - have access to this social security
37:45 - information as if no one's had access to
37:47 - it before as if the Biden Administration
37:49 - in 2023 had there was like 53 people
37:52 - some of them were students that had
37:54 - access to all this stuff yeah uh as it
37:57 - is there are uh tens of thousands of of
38:01 - federal employees that have access
38:03 - already to the system uh anyone from
38:05 - Doge has to go through the same vetting
38:07 - process that those those federal
38:10 - employees went through so there's not
38:11 - like some unvetted random
38:15 - situation if for example there's a
38:17 - security clearance needed uh the Doge
38:20 - person has to have that same security
38:22 - clearance so there's no um reduction in
38:27 - security um but I mean obviously the the
38:32 - the vast numbers of social security
38:33 - numbers have leaked onto the internet
38:35 - people have hacked the the government
38:36 - systems multiple times uh vast amounts
38:39 - of public information has been hacked
38:41 - and and uh DED on to the Internet so I
38:45 - me there's a guy at the IRS that leaked
38:47 - a half a million tax
38:50 - returns just a few years ago on purpose
38:54 - yeah for what reason uh I for politic he
38:58 - he he he wanted to I think he was trying
39:00 - to get a trump and maybe me and a few
39:02 - others um so but he he he he stole like
39:08 - 500,000 uh tax
39:11 - returns like not a few like it's a lot
39:14 - of tax Jesus Christ yeah oh I remember
39:17 - that story now remember you just you
39:19 - just read about it online it's not it's
39:21 - a real thing so these are the narratives
39:25 - that's the narrative that you shouldn't
39:26 - have access to social security the the
39:28 - other narrative is that starving people
39:30 - are going to die and women aren't going
39:32 - to be pregnant and not have nutrients
39:34 - for their babies and that's that's all
39:37 - you're hearing and um yeah well that's
39:40 - the that's the that's the only thing
39:41 - they they can say but they can point to
39:42 - the line item right um and so they can't
39:45 - say like well this is the thing where
39:48 - you know the nutrients for pregnant
39:52 - mothers were stopped this they can't
39:53 - point to that because we didn't right is
39:55 - a lie
39:57 - what's fascinating to me is um how much
40:01 - the mainstream media is in line with the
40:04 - very specific talking points and how
40:07 - little you you have Fox News you
40:10 - essentially have Fox News on television
40:12 - it's like the only one that is pointing
40:14 - out the ridiculous fraud and waste and
40:18 - yeah you know I know you saw the Jeff
40:20 - Bezos thing in the Washington Post
40:21 - they're going to stop all the wacky
40:23 - editorials and and limit that stuff to
40:27 - uh I think it was uh wealth and personal
40:30 - freedom or something along those lines
40:32 - yeah yeah so I mean I think it's
40:36 - this kind of I think it makes sense uh
40:39 - because he's just talking about the
40:40 - things not not the the sort of just
40:43 - talking about the opinions opinion
40:44 - pieces the opinion pieces yeah yeah so
40:46 - the regular journalism stays the same
40:48 - well it's a detriment to their business
40:51 - I mean you're seeing over and over again
40:53 - people that just they don't want to hear
40:54 - all this [ __ ] from these people anymore
40:56 - it's like you're you're you're saying
40:58 - it's almost like you're caught in an
41:00 - outdated version of the virus and
41:02 - everybody else already has the immunity
41:05 - to that virus like this is yeah you know
41:07 - like you need you need a new mind virus
41:10 - the one that you're pushing it's like it
41:12 - doesn't work anymore it's too crazy yeah
41:16 - uh it's the whole thing is very crazy um
41:19 - I mean the media is incredibly partisan
41:21 - I mean they're not uh I they take almost
41:24 - all the media is um you left shifted
41:28 - yeah so it's like it's kind of weird if
41:30 - you talk to somebody who gets all their
41:32 - information from like what I call Legacy
41:35 - Media uh they're living in a different
41:37 - world yeah uh than if they say are
41:39 - listening to you know U your podcast or
41:43 - um are getting new news from from X or
41:47 - you know just if it's it's like it's
41:51 - it's kind of wild like it is very wild
41:53 - like you talk it's it's like they're
41:54 - living in an Ultimate Reality oh there's
41:56 - a lot of people that I talked to to that
41:57 - I have to go where did you hear that
41:59 - yeah yeah uh but I mean like the
42:02 - Associated Press which I call Associated
42:04 - propaganda the AP um you know they they
42:07 - ran a a international news story saying
42:09 - that we that Doge fired air traffic
42:11 - controllers but we didn't fire any air
42:13 - traffic controllers at all in fact we're
42:15 - trying to hire air traffic controllers
42:17 - not fire them yeah I saw that you you
42:19 - made a tweet about it right yeah what do
42:21 - you call it now do you call it a post
42:24 - post yeah whatever you can't call it a
42:25 - tweet though do you call it a tweet
42:26 - accidentally I don't know
42:29 - listen uh but like if you if if one like
42:32 - let's say somebody post if somebody puts
42:34 - up like an you know two hour long video
42:37 - that's not a tweet right it's a post
42:40 - it's a PO yeah good point yeah yeah for
42:42 - sure yeah so um but I hot over if people
42:47 - still want to call it a tweet whatever
42:48 - you put a post about it just to get back
42:50 - to it saying that if you we need highly
42:53 - qualified air traffic controllers if you
42:55 - retired if you would consider doing it
42:57 - again we could use you uh yes so uh a
43:01 - lot of really qualified air traffic
43:02 - controllers were were pushed out because
43:04 - of Dei stuff so um I mean not to to be
43:09 - blunt I mean a bunch of old white a
43:10 - bunch of really good talented old white
43:13 - guys were pushed out it's not cool um
43:17 - and so we have there's a talent shortage
43:20 - in a traffic control because of Dei and
43:23 - and and not being not hiring people on
43:25 - Merit you know which is so crazy that
43:28 - that worked I think we we should not put
43:30 - the public safety at risk you know
43:32 - because of some demented philosophy
43:34 - somebody made a post today about it in
43:37 - infiltrating the NSA did you see any of
43:40 - that that was that was some gnarly stuff
43:44 - yeah crazy what they they they it
43:47 - started off as just like this sort of
43:49 - Fringe thing and people would meet up
43:51 - then it completely infiltrated the
43:52 - organization and they were spending all
43:54 - their time there like 400 people or
43:56 - something some like some chat sex chat
43:59 - room with like some extremely demented
44:03 - stuff yeah yeah I I know I sa it I'll
44:06 - send it to you Jamie because it's so
44:08 - cooky you you you what this is the NSA I
44:11 - thought the NSA was just all about like
44:14 - information
44:15 - and spy on you know like if like is a
44:19 - national threat or something yeah I
44:21 - think this is exactly it um so she uh
44:24 - more than 100 intelligence staffers will
44:26 - be fired over sexually explicit texts in
44:29 - NSA chat rooms Gabbert says um so so top
44:35 - intelligence official told Waters that
44:37 - the workers in question were Brazen and
44:38 - using an NSA platform intended for
44:41 - professional use to conduct this kind of
44:43 - really really horrific Behavior Uh what
44:45 - is the behavior what exactly what is it
44:48 - do they say in this
44:51 - article uh
44:53 - yeah I think they were also okay it says
44:55 - employees who participate in the n's
44:57 - obscene pornographic and sexually
44:59 - explicit chat
45:02 - rooms your tax dollars at work well it
45:05 - was all like de I it was all like LBGTQ
45:08 - stuff it was there was a lot of like
45:10 - transition stuff
45:12 - and yeah I I know I definitely saved it
45:15 - but point is um it had infiltrated the
45:18 - organization it's not what they should
45:19 - be talking about at all at all at all
45:22 - supposed to be protecting the country
45:24 - right and if you and people were talking
45:26 - about how they're sping half their time
45:28 - in these meetings and that they're just
45:30 - like constantly having to attend these
45:32 - things where they talk about these
45:34 - issues like what are what are you doing
45:37 - like if you have a problem with someone
45:38 - that's discriminatory get rid of that
45:41 - person that's it yes it's you problem's
45:44 - over you got someone who's homophobic in
45:46 - your business they're openly homophobic
45:47 - yeah that you can't work here that's not
45:49 - cool that's it that's it you don't have
45:51 - to have [ __ ] meetings constantly
45:53 - promoting this you're not going to
45:54 - change someone's opinion by berating
45:57 - them over and over again yeah I mean a
45:59 - work environment should be a
46:00 - professional environment where you know
46:02 - they're they're they're getting the job
46:04 - done that they're you
46:06 - know you know being paid to do uh that
46:10 - it should be obviously not supposed to
46:13 - be sort of getting paid for bizarre SE
46:17 - sexcapades it's just so fascinating that
46:20 - the virus was so strong that it made it
46:22 - into the NSA yes and was you would think
46:26 - those are some hard the CIA too the CIA
46:28 - was in there too yeah they were in there
46:30 - too which is bananas you would think
46:32 - same thing like hard-nosed like tough
46:34 - people doing hard work who can spy on
46:37 - you whenever they want
46:39 - yeah yeah and get revenge on you
46:42 - whenever they want
46:44 - yeah pretty wild yeah and you know they
46:50 - exist when the president leaves they
46:52 - stay people move around you stay a part
46:56 - of the organization for your entire
46:57 - career you get deeply entrenched in
46:59 - their system and how things work and
47:01 - who's back to rub and who's who's a bad
47:04 - guy who's a good guy who's on our side
47:06 - who's not
47:09 - yeah it's scary actually yeah um so was
47:14 - that what's taken so long with this
47:15 - Epstein files yeah what's up with that
47:18 - what is up with that it was like yeah
47:21 - it's it's like Lucy and the football
47:23 - with Charlie Brown when she always pulls
47:25 - that football away it's the same thing
47:29 - it's like they keep telling us they're
47:30 - going to release it day one oh day one
47:32 - we have a serious case of no one's being
47:34 - arrested O phobia you know well there's
47:35 - also right like what the [ __ ] is going
47:38 - on what the [ __ ] is going on also
47:39 - there's this real fear that someone's
47:41 - destroying the evidence and you keep
47:43 - hearing these stories unsubstantiated
47:45 - stories yeah of you know FBI people
47:47 - where the evidence I mean the guy had
47:49 - like tons of videos and uh recordings
47:52 - yeah I mean he had all sorts of things
47:54 - right like there's a mountain of
47:55 - evidence right so where's that mountain
47:57 - yeah where where is that mountain and
47:58 - what would be the reason why they would
48:01 - agree like there would have to be
48:03 - something in it for them to agree to not
48:07 - put it out
48:09 - right like there has to be some sort of
48:13 - financial entanglement some sort of
48:15 - relationship with the people that are on
48:17 - that list yeah that they can provide a
48:19 - value that was big enough for you to not
48:22 - release it or to slow relase it or to
48:24 - hope you can get away with like putting
48:25 - out some redacted files that don't show
48:28 - anything this is only red redacted
48:30 - redacted only stage one don't worry the
48:32 - real stuff's coming like that doesn't
48:34 - make any sense like why wouldn't you
48:36 - just release it all like what what could
48:38 - possibly be well worth protecting in
48:41 - there I mean I think I've got probably
48:43 - the same information that I mean I'm
48:44 - just reading what's what's the latest
48:45 - thing on the X you know I'm just looking
48:46 - at my X feed and I'm like yeah you know
48:49 - it's a real page Turner
48:52 - um and like I thought we were going to
48:55 - get some re Revelations to it was like
48:57 - big binders full of stuff there's got to
48:59 - be something in there well there was in
49:00 - all those people that were given a copy
49:02 - of it they were all like waving around
49:04 - they got the Willy Wonka ticket yeah
49:06 - yeah totally yeah and what happened
49:09 - nothing nothing so I think Laura lomer
49:13 - released it online I think I'm watching
49:16 - TW yeah she's not very pleased about
49:18 - this so does anybody find anything in
49:21 - there that's interesting no it's all old
49:22 - stuff from 2015 and okay what the [ __ ]
49:24 - is going on but but then apparently this
49:27 - they discovered a whole bunch of stuff
49:29 - at the southern dist District of New
49:30 - York right so that's and and and I'm
49:35 - like and I me I think you know Pam Bondi
49:38 - is actually great and cash Patel are
49:39 - great but they're like they just got
49:40 - there you know right so then they're
49:42 - they're in not they're they just got
49:43 - there but they're they're in a hostile
49:45 - environment they're not in a friendly
49:47 - environment right um so um you know it's
49:52 - like if you suddenly got put in captain
49:55 - of a ship but the crew was previously
49:57 - your enemy right the entire crew was
49:59 - previously your enemy right you know and
50:01 - you're telling them give me evidence
50:03 - yeah the crew doesn't want to give you
50:05 - the evidence you enemy they were like
50:07 - your mortal enemies just a moment ago
50:10 - you just got there yeah so yeah I think
50:12 - we got to give um you know um the
50:16 - attorney general and you know new
50:18 - director of the FBI some a little bit of
50:20 - slack here because they literally just
50:21 - got there I think so too but hey don't
50:24 - say you're going to release it on day
50:26 - one then yeah you shouldn't have said
50:27 - that sure and don't say you got a big
50:30 - drop coming tomorrow and that's some
50:32 - [ __ ] that's been around forever it's
50:34 - disappointing yeah what the and where's
50:36 - the JFK files where are those yeah let
50:40 - them go did they release anything on
50:41 - that front I don't know what's going on
50:44 - it can't be anything that's gotten to me
50:46 - yet so if nothing's gotten to me yet it
50:48 - can't be signicant if there's conspiracy
50:50 - evidence someone's going to send it yes
50:51 - Tim Dylan's going to text me 100% Tim
50:54 - Dylan Dave Smith someone's going to send
50:56 - my way theu yeah so it has it hasn't
50:58 - been released yet yeah you would find
51:01 - out and here's the real question like
51:03 - what could even be in there at this
51:05 - point that they haven't cleared out if
51:07 - you've got paperwork from 1963 like what
51:10 - is in there still what is in there that
51:13 - could possibly be incriminating that
51:15 - supposedly Trump said that if you saw
51:18 - what they showed me you wouldn't release
51:20 - it either okay what the [ __ ] does that I
51:23 - haven't seen it so Cashel has yes he
51:26 - said he seen it all yeah um can he just
51:29 - post it to his like X account or
51:32 - something I mean I just we that sounds
51:35 - like an Elon move I don't think he can
51:37 - he's the director of the FBI I think he
51:39 - has to go through proper channels and
51:41 - does he he has the channel I yeah but
51:43 - there's rules he sounds like Trump he
51:46 - sound like
51:47 - Trump he needs an executive order what
51:49 - about the storm I am the
51:51 - storm I mean what channels he is the
51:54 - channel well again imagine just getting
51:58 - to the the hull or just getting to the
52:00 - uh deck of the ship and you're the
52:02 - captain yeah and now you uh you have to
52:04 - figure out who's running things who's
52:07 - doing this where is everything yeah um
52:10 - yeah just getting getting anything done
52:13 - like just like said you're you just
52:16 - joined as Captain of a ship of where the
52:18 - crew hates your guts yeah they were your
52:20 - enemy yeah they were your enemy they're
52:24 - strongly opposed to anything you want to
52:25 - do yeah um and you're trying to give
52:27 - them orders and you're trying to expose
52:28 - them yeah they don't want to be exposed
52:31 - right you're you're literally people
52:32 - that are working there probably a part
52:34 - of this problem I mean I I was reading
52:36 - onx that like comey's daughter is like
52:39 - the lead prosecutor in southern district
52:40 - of New York did you read that yes and
52:43 - and like so obviously there's a bit of
52:44 - an entanglement there a little bit like
52:46 - what if there's something that uh you
52:48 - know makes puts her dad in a bad
52:52 - light exactly she a [ __ ] Shredder hit
52:55 - that delete button
52:57 - you know did you see uh General Flynn he
53:00 - was on a podcast and he he spoke
53:03 - directly to James Comey yeah he said Jim
53:06 - you're going to jail and unless you give
53:08 - up someone deeper than you and you know
53:10 - who that
53:11 - is you know who I'm talking about like
53:14 - that is wild yeah um I think that the
53:17 - former director of the FBI might be
53:20 - really in that kind of deep [ __ ] and he
53:22 - really actually was doing some evil
53:24 - corrupt [ __ ] while he run in the FBI I
53:28 - mean it seems like there's some very
53:29 - shady stuff that's been going on um it
53:32 - seems like it definitely happened in
53:33 - the' 60s right everybody kind of admits
53:35 - to that they admit the FBI uh killed
53:38 - black panthers they they did they did a
53:40 - lot of [ __ ] there's a lot of stuff that
53:42 - went on that we know the government did
53:45 - way back in the day yeah why don't we
53:47 - just data dump the files just like go in
53:50 - there take photos of of all the papers
53:52 - presumably paper um and just post it
53:55 - online and and uh let let the CHS fall
53:58 - where they may is it presumably everyone
54:01 - like some like filing cabinet somewhere
54:02 - I don't know right where is it where's
54:04 - where's the magic filing cabinet how are
54:07 - they hiding it who's got access to it
54:08 - like this this is what I was hoping day
54:11 - one I was hoping but obviously it's
54:13 - taking a lot longer than that so I I
54:16 - think part of it is like you know like
54:17 - let's let's say let's say you were made
54:19 - direct to the FBI okay I might be able
54:23 - to that's what crazy literally you know
54:26 - what's he doing now he's he's one of the
54:28 - big dogs of theba but
54:30 - he Secret Service guy yeah legit guy but
54:33 - people think of him as a Fox News guy
54:35 - just like Pete heg same thing they don't
54:37 - want to think about his distinguished
54:38 - military career they want to say oh that
54:40 - Fox News guy director deputy director of
54:43 - the Federal Bureau of Investigation I
54:45 - mean Dan's hardcore I me if he if it's
54:47 - if it's reasonably findable I think he's
54:49 - going to find it this is between him and
54:51 - cash I mean like I think they're going
54:52 - to get stuff how crazy would it be if
54:54 - they couldn't though how crazy would it
54:55 - be if they can't find anything if it's
54:57 - that if if everybody shuts their mouth
54:59 - and everybody covers their ass like an
55:01 - FBI computer where you type in the
55:03 - search that's I I just like the basic
55:06 - mechanism here like it's either in a
55:08 - filing cabinet in in paper where it's
55:10 - like you know maybe there's like
55:12 - Progressive levels of security you know
55:13 - you're like open this door oh you got to
55:15 - have do you have the pass for this level
55:17 - you like level unlocked and there's a
55:19 - level unlocked and it's like get
55:22 - there
55:24 - laptop yeah yeah there's laptop you
55:28 - gotta only plug it in it's in a skiff
55:30 - yeah this is why like I think I think
55:32 - like tour of four KNX would be awesome
55:33 - like a live tour of Fort Knox we can
55:35 - actually see it's like is the C there or
55:37 - not they say it is is it real or did
55:40 - somebody spray paint some lead you know
55:42 - imagine if it's not imagine if it's not
55:44 - all there like some of it's missing
55:45 - where to go what if a lot of it's
55:46 - missing what if like half of it's
55:49 - missing I mean who how do we even know I
55:52 - don't know they said the last time they
55:54 - let someone look at it was decades ago
55:56 - yeah well the last I believe the last
55:58 - formal audit was in the
56:01 - 50s so I'm like okay oh my just think
56:05 - about all the
56:07 - other maybe yeah think about all the
56:10 - other stuff that you pointed out all the
56:11 - the the checks that just go out the the
56:14 - NGO payments the Social Security people
56:16 - think about all just all that now apply
56:18 - that to the gold absolutely I just want
56:20 - to like emphasize the sure Madness of
56:23 - the the government it's it's just
56:25 - because they have like m the Magic Money
56:27 - computers that that they the checks all
56:29 - the checks never bounce for the federal
56:30 - government like so you don't have the
56:32 - the normal corrective mechanism that
56:33 - you'd have for a company or for an
56:35 - individual the checks just always always
56:38 - always clear the net result is inflation
56:40 - which is effectively a tax on everyone
56:42 - um but uh you know like the defense Pro
56:46 - hasn't passed an audit in I don't know
56:48 - how many years seven years yeah I mean
56:50 - exactly so it's like You' have to be
56:52 - freaking Chuck Norris to like only Chuck
56:55 - Norris could get the defense department
56:57 - to pass an order you know typee of thing
56:58 - that's the level of skill you need you
57:00 - know um well that's what's so insane if
57:02 - you bring it back to the idea that it's
57:03 - a business well yeah this would never be
57:06 - tolerated in any kind of functional
57:07 - business exactly so U you
57:12 - know um you know Pentagon will will like
57:16 - like their accounting error like the
57:17 - stuff that that they lose in the couch
57:19 - cushions is like 20 30 B billion dollars
57:21 - a year they don't know don't know where
57:23 - it
57:24 - went it's gone
57:27 - where it go and it's
57:29 - gone it's so insane it's insane it's so
57:33 - insane so that's why I said like even
57:35 - simple things like just requiring that
57:37 - the that outgoing payments for the
57:39 - treasury computer have a payment code
57:41 - and a comment of what the payment is
57:43 - about and someone to call about the
57:46 - payment um I think will have an very
57:49 - powerful effect in stopping wasteful
57:52 - outflows and stopping fraud yeah and and
57:54 - here's another way to look at this
57:56 - imagine if some there are people like
57:59 - you and the Doge team out there in the
58:01 - world imagine if one of those works for
58:05 - an organization like us a or any other
58:08 - organization and has this understanding
58:11 - of how much fuckeries involved but they
58:14 - have evil intentions and they're
58:16 - entwined in this system for decades and
58:19 - decades and they've built a career and
58:21 - all the entanglements that come and they
58:23 - start moving [ __ ] around
58:26 - you could probably do it easy it sounds
58:28 - like the way you've laid it out if you
58:30 - were a career person who's in there
58:32 - forever who knew how everything works Y
58:35 - and you were very clever you could make
58:38 - some [ __ ] happen and you could probably
58:40 - do it in conjunction with some people
58:41 - that you know that are forming an NGO
58:44 - hey let's all work together yeah yeah
58:49 - and this is the resistance that you're
58:50 - facing yeah the I think it's the biggest
58:53 - scam of all time this is not something
58:55 - you ever saw
58:56 - the biggest scam of all time ever of
59:00 - human history of human history yes
59:03 - wow I think you're right yeah I how what
59:07 - else probably a trillion dollar scam
59:09 - there's never been a trillion dollar
59:09 - scam you
59:13 - know now this is not something that you
59:15 - ever set out to do this is not you
59:18 - didn't have this as a career aspiration
59:20 - this is not like this is the most absurd
59:22 - outcome I can possibly imagine actually
59:24 - also like Doge started as like a sort of
59:26 - a a meme coin right you know it was like
59:28 - a a joke cryptocurrency involving memes
59:33 - and dogs mhm um and uh which is so funny
59:37 - that the letters wind up being perfect
59:39 - yeah well actually I was originally
59:41 - going a quote like the government
59:42 - efficiency commission which is very
59:43 - boring name um and then people online
59:46 - were no it needs to be the department of
59:48 - government efficiency uh and I was like
59:50 - you know what you're right of course of
59:52 - course of course I mean it's more
59:54 - evidence of the simulation that that
59:58 - little like a mascot is a is a cute
60:03 - dog it's a meme coin the meme coin is
60:05 - probably worth a lot of money right now
60:06 - right like every time you tweet about it
60:08 - probably I don't know shoots up yeah the
60:11 - the mem the whole meme coin thing is
60:13 - bananas yeah it is so bananas that
60:15 - people dump real money into these coins
60:19 - and then you could just pump them up and
60:21 - sell them a casino or something I don't
60:22 - know yeah it's totally G people just do
60:24 - whatever the greater fo and musical
60:27 - chairs and whoever's like the last to
60:29 - sit down lose type of thing and somehow
60:31 - or another it's still legal like that's
60:33 - that's think not I think not too many
60:36 - people I
60:38 - mean I mean it's sort of like you go to
60:40 - the casino like you if you expect to win
60:42 - at the casino you're being a fool okay
60:45 - so I think if you expect to win at meme
60:47 - coins you're being it's not you're being
60:50 - foolish yeah yeah you're not gonna win a
60:52 - meme coins it's like it's it's but if if
60:56 - if you want like don't sink your life
60:57 - savings into a meme coin no but you can
60:59 - gamble a little and you can ride waves
61:02 - and win a little and lose a little if if
61:04 - you want to have some fun and and don't
61:06 - come then you know play have play with
61:08 - me and coins but if you put your if you
61:12 - put your on a m coin in the at the RIS
61:15 - of saying something bold and outrageous
61:17 - don't bet the F on a
61:19 - mcoin the weird one is the pump and
61:21 - dumps like people all time all the time
61:25 - and people get shocked that somebody
61:26 - pump and dumped like what is what are
61:29 - you doing did you like I was hoping to
61:32 - dump I was hoping to make all the money
61:34 - out of this I can't believe they got me
61:35 - like yeah it's just weird that it's
61:38 - legal
61:40 - still uh I mean casinos IL legal and and
61:44 - people just lose money at casinos you
61:46 - know but you can't rig a casino like a
61:48 - pump and dump you could rig a pump and
61:50 - dump you know uh yeah I guess so
61:54 - um like you could run a real pyramid
61:58 - scheme well I mean the government's one
61:59 - a big pyramid scheme if you ask me yeah
62:01 - well you you can tell Social Security is
62:04 - is the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time
62:07 - right explain that oh so um well people
62:10 - pay into Social Security um and and the
62:14 - money goes out of Social Security
62:15 - immediately but the obligation for
62:17 - Social Security is uh your entire
62:20 - retirement career so you're you're
62:23 - paying uh with your the
62:26 - you're paying like like if you look at
62:29 - the future obligations of Social
62:30 - Security it far exceeds uh the tax
62:35 - revenue far have you ever looked at the
62:38 - the the debt The Debt Clock yes okay
62:42 - there's there's there's our present day
62:43 - debt but then there's our future
62:45 - obligations so when you look at the
62:47 - future obligations of Social Security um
62:50 - the actual uh national debt is like
62:53 - double what what people think it is
62:56 - because of the future
62:58 - obligations ah so basically people are
63:02 - living way longer than expected um
63:06 - and uh there are fewer babies being born
63:09 - so you have more people who are retired
63:11 - and get that that live for a long time
63:14 - and get retirement payments so the
63:16 - future obligations so H how bad the
63:19 - financial situation is right now for the
63:21 - federal government it will be much worse
63:23 - in the future
63:26 - at the risk of being a buzz kill here
63:28 - did you see so we better fix what we got
63:30 - right now because if it's bad now it's
63:31 - going to be much worse in the future
63:33 - there was an interview with this woman
63:34 - who was a whistleblower did we ever find
63:36 - out if that was true there's so many
63:37 - whistles being blown it's hard to keep
63:39 - track a lot of whistles this one lady it
63:42 - was only in one state it was very
63:44 - specific instance believe right but it
63:46 - was using Social Security money correct
63:48 - that was her that was her allegation so
63:51 - what what she was alleging was that she
63:53 - was in charge of turning uh illegal
63:56 - immigrants into clients that's what they
63:58 - would call them and that she would go to
64:00 - them and try to ask them do you have a
64:02 - headache do you have back problems if
64:04 - you do now you can be permanently
64:07 - disabled you get permanent disability so
64:09 - you get Social Security for Life yes
64:11 - yeah no not just Social Security but
64:12 - disability which is even more right and
64:14 - you get them for on the taxpayer Dole
64:17 - right away the m and they're illegal
64:18 - aliens yes oh so if I were to say like
64:22 - what's at the heart of the sort of like
64:25 - why is a Democrat propaganda machine so
64:28 - fired up to destroy me that's the main
64:31 - reason the main reason is that uh is
64:36 - that um uh entitlements fraud that
64:40 - includes like Social Security Disability
64:43 - Medicaid uh entitlements fraud for
64:45 - illegal aliens is what is serving as a
64:49 - gigantic magnetic force to pull people
64:51 - in from all around the world and keep
64:53 - them here like basically
64:56 - if you if you pay people uh at a
64:58 - standard of living that is above 90% of
65:01 - Earth then you have a very powerful
65:06 - uh incentive for 90% of Earth to come
65:09 - here and to stay here but if you if you
65:14 - end the illegal alien fraud then you
65:17 - that you turn off that
65:18 - magnet and they leave and they they stop
65:22 - coming and and the ones that are here
65:23 - many of them will simply leave
65:27 - and if if that happens a massive they
65:30 - will lose a massive number of democratic
65:32 - voters and if it didn't happen they
65:34 - would turn those people into voters
65:36 - correct which they were trying to do
65:38 - they are already turning them so in in
65:40 - New York state illegal aliens can
65:42 - already vote in state and city
65:45 - elections a lot of people don't don't
65:47 - know that there there's I mean they're
65:49 - trying to fight that in they're trying
65:50 - to stop that but it's there currently I
65:53 - think it's like
65:54 - 600,000 uh are Reg said to vote illegal
65:56 - aliens in New York that is wild yeah
66:00 - well well I mean if you look at
66:04 - say um you know FEMA like the the agency
66:09 - that was paying for illegal aliens to
66:11 - stay at luxury hotels in New York was
66:15 - FEMA the F you know that's meant that
66:18 - that's an agency that's meant to support
66:20 - Americans in distress from natural
66:22 - disasters was paying for luxury hotels
66:26 - for illegals in New York it's true yeah
66:29 - that's a fact fact they're literally
66:31 - like when we stuff that payment we we
66:33 - stopped all those those money because
66:35 - that's obviously an insane way to spend
66:37 - taxpayer money um the uh New York uh
66:41 - sued the government Su the federal
66:42 - government to get the
66:45 - money so you can just look at their
66:47 - lawsuit they they were give they were
66:49 - sending that money even after president
66:53 - Trump signed an executive order saying
66:55 - it needs to to
66:56 - stop they still press sand on $80
67:00 - million to luxury hotels in New York
67:03 - your tax money went to pay for illegal
67:06 - aliens in luxury hotels in New York from
67:10 - an agency that is meant to help
67:12 - Americans in distress from natural
67:15 - disasters right and I would like to know
67:17 - how much and I would like to know how
67:18 - much they spent on North Carolina and
67:20 - how much they spent on Maui yes
67:22 - exactly uh what What's actually happened
67:25 - is they're buying
67:26 - voters that's really what's happening
67:28 - it's like it's like a giant voter for
67:31 - scam they're importing
67:34 - voters and uh and it's really just a
67:37 - matter of time so like a lot of people
67:39 - have trouble believing this but if you
67:42 - the more you look at it the more you
67:45 - will realize just how much of a problem
67:48 - this is and how it's it's it's not just
67:51 - real it
67:53 - is it is an attempt to destroy
67:56 - Democracy in America that's what in my
67:58 - view it is what it really is like if you
68:01 - take the the the sort of seven swing
68:03 - States like often the imin of Victory
68:06 - there is like maybe 20,000 votes if you
68:09 - put 200,000 um illegals in there and
68:13 - they have like a 80% likelihood of
68:16 - voting
68:17 - them uh and it's only a matter of time
68:19 - before they become citizens then those
68:21 - swing States will not be swing states in
68:24 - the future and if they are not swing
68:26 - States we will be a permanent one party
68:29 - State
68:30 - country
68:32 - permanent uh deep blue socialist State
68:35 - that's what America will become and that
68:37 - was the game plan that that was that was
68:39 - the game plan that is still the game
68:42 - plan and they almost succeeded if if if
68:46 - if the if the machine of which the Kam
68:49 - puppet was the representation had won
68:52 - that's what would have happened the
68:54 - reason I went so hardcore for for for
68:57 - for Trump was
68:58 - because to me this was a folk in the
69:00 - road very like a very obvious folk in
69:03 - the road
69:05 - um if they had another four years they
69:07 - would legalize enough illegals in the
69:09 - swing states to make the swing States
69:13 - uh not swing States they would just
69:16 - there would be blue
69:17 - States then then they would they would
69:20 - win the presidential they'd win the
69:22 - house the Senate and the presidency
69:26 - um they would then make uh District you
69:29 - know DC into a state may maybe Puerto
69:33 - Rico get four extra Senators pack the
69:35 - Supreme Court so then you'll have the
69:37 - house Judiciary
69:39 - Senate uh and presidency all blue and
69:43 - then they will keep importing more
69:45 - illegals to cement that that outcome
69:48 - basically what happened in
69:53 - California Jesus Christ it would have
69:55 - been the
69:56 - end that's why I went so hardcore for
69:59 - for trump it was otherwise been the end
70:02 - and that's why the the the Democrat
70:05 - machine is so intent on destroying
70:08 - me it's just so fascinating that people
70:11 - can't see this I mean I invite people to
70:15 - do their research the more they do their
70:16 - research the more they will see that
70:18 - what I'm saying is absolutely
70:20 - true D it's like just do the research
70:25 - yeah it's it's such a bad idea even for
70:28 - the Democrats which is what they don't
70:30 - understand like it's the same it's not
70:32 - ultimately going to work out no it's the
70:34 - same people yes it's just they're doing
70:37 - it under the guys that they're the kind
70:39 - compassionate Progressive people yes but
70:42 - the same outcome takes place it's just
70:43 - about control they they probably
70:46 - Institute some Central Bank digital
70:47 - currency and some social credit score
70:50 - system and censorship of course yeah of
70:52 - course well they that was the big Fe
70:55 - coming into this election was that if
70:57 - they can't censor things like well I we
70:59 - talked about it before but there's there
71:01 - was two major Forks in the road the big
71:03 - one was Trump didn't get shot y the
71:05 - other big one was You by Twitter and if
71:07 - those two things don't happen the whole
71:10 - world looks different yes yeah we don't
71:14 - want to be on that timeline no we don't
71:15 - want to have only one side represented
71:18 - because guess what they will hijack that
71:20 - side whatever it is they will hijack
71:22 - that side and use it for money and
71:24 - control and that's what it's all about
71:26 - it's not about good people versus bad
71:27 - people it's a [ __ ] shell game yeah I
71:30 - I mean I think these things are actually
71:33 - it's easy to understand if you look at
71:35 - basic incentives the the basic incentive
71:38 - here is the more legals that the
71:40 - Democrats can bring in the more likely
71:42 - they are to win so that's what they're
71:44 - going to
71:45 - do um that's what they have been doing
71:49 - uh and it worked in California
71:50 - California super majority Dem um and
71:53 - look at all the companies that are
71:54 - leaving California
71:55 - yeah um I mean in and- out just
71:58 - announced they're leaving their
71:59 - headquarters leaving California they're
72:00 - moving to Tennessee yeah yeah
72:03 - so um and and California uh made
72:08 - Healthcare free for illegals yeah as of
72:11 - last year so and and that obviously
72:14 - that's a gigantic magnet for more
72:16 - illegals like and this is not a thing
72:19 - you can solve simply with money because
72:20 - what happens is the you simply have more
72:23 - patients than a doctor can possibly see
72:25 - and you can't just you know make doctors
72:28 - out of nothing like the it so people
72:31 - like oh it's just a money thing no you
72:33 - it takes a long time for somebody to
72:35 - become a doctor you know the 30 years um
72:39 - and uh and so what actually happens in
72:42 - California is that there are too many
72:44 - patients for the doctors to see so then
72:49 - uh the average citizen in California
72:51 - suffers as a result um now the the elite
72:56 - in California are fine because they have
72:57 - private doctors you know they have they
72:59 - can they can just pay for the best
73:01 - doctors so the elite in California doing
73:03 - fine but your your average C citizen in
73:05 - California is not doing fine um and the
73:09 - the tax burden for uh healthcare for
73:11 - illegals was supposed to be three
73:12 - billion I think they now estimated it's
73:14 - 9 billion but that but that that number
73:15 - will scale to Infinity basically it's
73:18 - like why not like why not if you if you
73:22 - need any operation at all come to
73:24 - California and have it be free right
73:27 - from anywhere on earth and the people
73:29 - that want to look at it in the most
73:31 - charitable way they say oh well these
73:33 - people are hardworking good people and
73:36 - they're the backbone of our city and
73:38 - they should have access to all the
73:39 - things that we have access to and I just
73:42 - don't think they understand that it's a
73:43 - political Pawn I don't think they
73:45 - understand this is not done for
73:47 - compassion and kindness no this is just
73:50 - done to ensure that it stays Blue
73:52 - correct yeah and it's essentially a
73:54 - bribery with your tax dollars yes this
73:56 - is why um that the dams will not even um
74:03 - Deport criminals yeah um because every
74:07 - criminal deported is a lost vote so even
74:10 - even if if somebody is uh um illegal
74:13 - with a criminal record and commits crime
74:15 - in America they are still still were not
74:18 - being
74:19 - deported and then on top of that
74:21 - California made it actually illegal to
74:24 - ask for ID when people vote Yes
74:26 - California and New York uh you are not
74:29 - allowed to show your ID when you vote I
74:32 - just want to be clear so everyone
74:34 - understands this in California New York
74:36 - you are not allowed to show your ID even
74:38 - if you want to
74:40 - right why would that ever be a good
74:44 - idea I mean what like if you want to man
74:49 - if you're trying to do if you're trying
74:50 - to facilitate fraud in elections it's a
74:52 - great idea that's the only reason yes
74:54 - there's no other reason Lally why that
74:56 - would be a good idea it's for fraud it's
74:58 - it's like it's like wake up
75:01 - she wake up hello like let's say you
75:05 - wanted to commit for what are the things
75:06 - you would do yeah you would say you
75:08 - don't need ID and you can mail in your
75:11 - ballot and we'll give you free healthare
75:13 - yes stay here yes stay here I know it's
75:15 - on fire but stay here I mean in this
75:17 - case it being on fire is not just a
75:20 - metaphor in California okay it's just
75:22 - like godamn
75:25 - entire neighborhood's burning down it's
75:27 - just once they uh allowed people to vote
75:30 - that are not legal in
75:33 - California once you if you're if you're
75:35 - going to do that it's it's over it's
75:37 - exactly there's there's no coming back
75:39 - from that the numbers are just no people
75:42 - are so indoctrinated too there's so many
75:44 - people that no matter what they think
75:46 - voting Republican means you're an
75:47 - [ __ ] yes and they won't do it they
75:50 - won't do it they they'll put their
75:51 - [ __ ] rainbow flag on their porch and
75:53 - they'll just ride it right into the
75:54 - beach civilizational suicide yeah right
75:57 - to the Rocks bang crash the boat I mean
76:00 - uh there's there's a guy um who post X
76:02 - who's who great God Gods side yeah
76:05 - friend of mine he been on podcast punch
76:07 - times yeah he's awesome yeah he's great
76:09 - um and he talks about uh you know
76:11 - basically suicidal empathy mhm like if
76:15 - there's like there's so much empathy
76:17 - that you actually suicide yourself yeah
76:20 - um so that we've got civilizational
76:23 - suicidal empathy going on and it's like
76:26 - I believe in empathy like I think you
76:27 - should care about other people but you
76:29 - need to have empathy for for
76:30 - civilization as a whole and not commit
76:32 - to a civilizational suicide also don't
76:34 - let someone use your empathy against you
76:37 - so they can completely control your
76:38 - state and then do it insanely bad job of
76:41 - managing it and never get
76:44 - removed the the the fundamental weakness
76:47 - of Western Civilization is
76:50 - empathy the empathy exploit they there
76:54 - it's it's they're exploiting a a a bug
76:57 - in western civilization which is the
77:00 - empathy
77:01 - response so and I I I think you know
77:04 - empathy is good but you need to think it
77:06 - through and not just
77:08 - be programmed like a robot right
77:11 - understand when empathy has been
77:12 - actually used as a to a tool yes like
77:15 - the it's weaponized empathy yeah is the
77:18 - issue yeah weaponized empathy and yeah
77:23 - um and it's also the rigid adherence to
77:25 - that liberal ideology like you can't
77:28 - switch sides over there like California
77:31 - if you're a part of that whole Tech
77:33 - Hollywood entertainment any any of those
77:36 - circles you're on the left like almost
77:40 - wholly almost completely it's borderline
77:43 - illegal to be a republican in California
77:46 - uh I mean like in San Francisco or La
77:49 - it's borderline illegal to be a
77:50 - republican you're certainly shunned no I
77:52 - look I mean in like San Francisco you
77:55 - you you could shoot heroin while taking
77:57 - a dump on the mayor's car in front of
77:59 - City Hall okay and and that and nothing
78:02 - would happen to
78:04 - you but if you walk down the street with
78:06 - a Maga hat you're GNA get
78:09 - attacked yeah it's insane yeah it's
78:13 - insane it's also so orwellian that a hat
78:16 - that says make America great again would
78:19 - cause people to have a violent reaction
78:22 - like aren't you American wouldn't just
78:24 - just as a a whole like the saying
78:27 - wouldn't that be a good thing for
78:28 - everyone make America great again but
78:31 - because it's attached to Donald Trump
78:32 - and that red hat you'll get maced for
78:35 - wearing that red hat they will make
78:38 - America worse by beating you so it's
78:42 - like it's an evil thing they're
78:43 - doing a violent assault in America
78:46 - because you want to make America great
78:49 - again I mean it's like a scene in a book
78:52 - it doesn't it doesn't seem like it could
78:55 - be that ridiculous like remember when
78:57 - all lives matter would get you fired
79:00 - which is insane insane people got fired
79:03 - because they said all lives matter which
79:05 - is a very reasonable thing to say how
79:08 - reasonable is that yes that's
79:09 - essentially saying everybody matters but
79:12 - that's not that's Lally all you're
79:13 - saying that's not what you were supposed
79:15 - to say you had to say black lives matter
79:17 - which of course they do if you say all
79:19 - lives matter everybody matters yes but
79:22 - the idea of being a colorblind Society
79:24 - was completely abandoned somewhere
79:26 - around
79:27 - 2012-ish yeah I mean I I sort of can
79:29 - trace it to when when did the the the
79:31 - gun emoji get nerfed you know uh when
79:34 - did it turn into a squirt gun that was a
79:35 - couple of years ago that was like 2016 I
79:38 - think was it yeah yeah it became a
79:40 - squirt
79:41 - gun can you bring it back X yeah no no
79:44 - right now if if if you uh use a gun
79:47 - emoji on X the Apple will insist that
79:51 - it' be a squirt gun and then the X app
79:53 - turns it back into uh a 1911 oh really
79:57 - yeah oh that's great so you can you can
79:59 - actually uh you know have have a 1911
80:03 - gun um we we we reverted the Apple
80:07 - change inside the app oh that's
80:09 - hilarious that's hilarious that that
80:11 - it's that thing's so offensive the gun
80:13 - and then the pregnant man both of those
80:15 - got me like you
80:19 - [ __ ] I mean I like that mem
80:21 - where it's like the people telling you
80:23 - that what you're hearing is dis
80:24 - information are the same people that did
80:26 - the pregnant man emoji yes yeah think
80:29 - about that yeah well also the same
80:32 - people that say a woman attacked a Tesla
80:35 - Factory yeah the woman it's a dude it's
80:38 - a dude like really obvious dude really
80:41 - big mentally ill dude yeah mentally ill
80:43 - dude with a wig on say that yes yeah but
80:47 - NBC even fo you're looking at the
80:50 - picture a woman yo this is got a this
80:53 - this is a dude with a wrong jawline okay
80:55 - he's wearing Woman
80:57 - face is a buff it's a buff dude yeah
81:00 - it's a buff dude wearing Woman face I
81:03 - mean come on that's not a that's not a
81:05 - woman yeah and they're like saying watch
81:08 - shot for disinformation I'm like what
81:09 - are you talking about it's so crazy this
81:11 - is [ __ ] I mean it's just more
81:14 - evidence of the virus though right like
81:16 - it killed objectivity killed reality and
81:20 - it it demanded strict adherence or you
81:23 - were attacked yeah
81:25 - yeah any questioning of it uh would
81:27 - result in in being ostracized do you
81:30 - like what what kind of responsibility do
81:32 - you like knowing that if you didn't take
81:35 - over Twitter and turn it into X if that
81:38 - didn't happen like the I really think
81:42 - the world's a very different place right
81:44 - now like how long have you owned it for
81:47 - a couple years basically imag imagine a
81:49 - couple years of it being run the way it
81:51 - was run before and probably accelerating
81:54 - my account would have been suspended
81:55 - long
81:56 - ago for sure yeah for sure yeah just for
82:00 - the
82:02 - disinformation
82:04 - yeah um it would have been Trum would
82:06 - have never come back Alex Jones would
82:07 - have definitely never been back
82:09 - definitely not no no um
82:14 - so yeah um does that weigh on you like I
82:17 - would feel like that would be a [ __ ]
82:19 - heavy
82:21 - responsibility
82:23 - yeah um I mean I'm just trying to keep
82:25 - civilization going here you know for
82:29 - longer um
82:32 - so
82:34 - um I think we at least want to build a
82:37 - city on Mars um and become a multiplet
82:42 - civilization uh which I think would be
82:46 - incredibly important in ensuring the
82:49 - long-term survival of
82:52 - civilization are you still rescuing
82:54 - those people that are stuck in the space
82:55 - station uh yeah that's coming up in a
82:57 - couple weeks I think whoa they've been
83:00 - up there for how long Jamie they were
83:01 - supposed to be there for a couple days
83:03 - right I think actually prob like four
83:04 - weeks oh they're supposed to be they
83:06 - were supposed to be up there for like
83:07 - eight days yeah and they've been up
83:09 - there for like I think eight months so a
83:12 - little longer than expected [ __ ] yeah
83:15 - what is it going to be like for those
83:16 - people when they get back they're going
83:17 - to be a wreck for a long time right yeah
83:19 - if as long you stay up there you get you
83:21 - know sort of in zero you get increased
83:23 - bone loss so
83:25 - um you it ended up being like this
83:27 - political football um and uh sort of
83:31 - sort of hotly contested topic um we
83:34 - offered to bring them back early this
83:36 - offer was rejected by the Biden
83:38 - Administration whyl for political
83:41 - reasons that's so crazy I there's no way
83:43 - that they're going to make anyone who's
83:44 - supporting Trump look look
83:46 - good
83:48 - wow what do you think they would have
83:50 - done if they had
83:52 - won uh well get those people back no
83:55 - they can they can only get them back
83:56 - with with a SpaceX spacecraft but they
83:58 - they push the return date past the uh
84:00 - inauguration
84:02 - date wow
84:04 - yeah so they would have let you do it
84:07 - but after the
84:10 - wow and so it would have been them
84:12 - authorizing you there isn't anyone else
84:14 - to to to do it NASA can't get them uh
84:18 - the only only the SpaceX Dragon
84:21 - spacecraft is the only one that is
84:23 - considered safe enough to bring them
84:24 - back so the NASA concluded that the
84:28 - Boeing spacecraft was not safe so that's
84:30 - why they're stuck there holy [ __ ] yeah
84:33 - and you can't ask Russia to help that
84:35 - would be awkward a little bit yeah yeah
84:38 - be a nice thing if they did they said
84:39 - guys will help you I think they for
84:42 - enough money they would you think so uh
84:45 - yeah but they would they would obviously
84:47 - treat it as a propaganda Victory and
84:49 - charge crazy
84:52 - money it's just disgusting that they
84:54 - would use that as a political
84:56 - tool yeah um yeah um so well they were
85:03 - also the Biden Administration was also
85:04 - suing SpaceX uh they had this massive
85:07 - lawsuit against SpaceX for SpaceX not
85:11 - hiring Asylum Seekers right so so people
85:14 - like say like oh El's making it up this
85:17 - V Administration wasn't against SpaceX
85:19 - I'm like bro the Department of Justice
85:23 - had a massive lawy law suit against
85:24 - SpaceX for not hiring Asylum Seekers
85:26 - even though it is illegal for us to hire
85:29 - hire anyone who is not a permanent
85:31 - resident so it is both there's a law
85:34 - that says you have to hire Asylum
85:35 - Seekers but there's also a law that says
85:38 - anyone hired by a rocket company which
85:41 - is an advanced weapons technology must
85:44 - be a permanent resident and if an asylum
85:46 - Seeker is not a permanent resident so it
85:48 - is both legal and illegal to hire Asylum
85:51 - Seekers
85:54 - so why would the vien Administration
85:57 - launch a massive lawsuit again this is
85:59 - public information it's not like my
86:02 - imagination um why would they launch do
86:05 - such a massive lawsuit against
86:06 - SpaceX they're extremely
86:12 - antagonistic it just doesn't make any
86:14 - sense that that could ever even get past
86:17 - the first day of someone looking at it
86:20 - if it's both illegal and you're trying
86:22 - to enforce it like you can't enforce it
86:24 - yes this is an advanced weapons company
86:26 - this is crazy it should be like this
86:28 - throw this out there's in fact there's
86:31 - like International traffic and arms
86:32 - regulations is a like a law that is
86:36 - there to ensure that if if only
86:40 - permanent residents of the United States
86:42 - can work at Advanced weapons companies
86:45 - Rockets are Advanced weapons uh so the
86:48 - same is true of like if it's like
86:49 - nuclear or you know some like you know
86:52 - bioweapon thing or something like that
86:54 - um so because they obviously if if
86:58 - someone were to work at basic and then
87:00 - go leave and go to North Korea or Iran
87:03 - they could build missile technology that
87:05 - could uh you know destroy the United
87:08 - States so that's why you're not allow to
87:11 - hire people who are per resident logical
87:13 - basic logical logical so is that lawsuit
87:15 - still pending I was it was just
87:19 - dismissed how long was it going on for a
87:21 - couple years holy [ __ ]
87:25 - yeah that's the other thing that drives
87:27 - me crazy like that people don't
87:30 - understand that if you sanction laware
87:32 - like that if you sanction attacking your
87:34 - political enemies someone's going to do
87:36 - that to you like if the wrong people get
87:39 - in office yeah if new people getting off
87:42 - four years from now eight years from now
87:44 - who knows who it's going to be you've
87:45 - already set a precedent you've already
87:48 - attack someone charged them with 34
87:50 - felonies where they're really just
87:52 - misdemeanors and they're passed the
87:54 - statute of limitation and now you're
87:57 - talking all over the news that this is a
88:00 - convicted felon convicted felon they
88:02 - kept saying convicted felon convicted
88:04 - felon and everybody knows what it is yes
88:06 - it's terrifying it's terrifying they
88:08 - could do it so brazenly to a guy who was
88:11 - the president for four years right um
88:16 - that lawsuit was funded by Reed Hoffman
88:19 - uh who is a major damned
88:21 - donor and also an FD and client
88:24 - [Music]
88:26 - uh the pl the plot thickens the plot
88:29 - thickens Jesus Christ
88:32 - yes it's
88:35 - just it's so blatant it's like so
88:38 - obvious the SpaceX lawsuit the Trump
88:40 - stuff it's just it's so obvious yes like
88:43 - known FC clients um who are obviously
88:46 - extremely powerful um they powerful
88:49 - politically and and very wealthy um are
88:53 - you know bullate
88:56 - um Bill Clinton and Reed
88:59 - Hoffman and some others two but those
89:03 - three so you know why was Reed Hoffman
89:06 - so intent on destroying
89:10 - Trump do you think it's because they're
89:11 - worried about the list coming
89:14 - out yeah one of the
89:18 - reasons
89:19 - yeah so I mean I'm like this is you know
89:23 - yeah
89:24 - so it's so frustrating to be sitting in
89:26 - the situation where the the list isn't
89:28 - coming out well it better come out I
89:30 - mean hopefully tomorrow might well I
89:32 - mean why' they release [ __ ] today I
89:34 - don't know what's the point in giving
89:36 - these people like a a happy folder to
89:38 - wave around in front of the camera with
89:39 - nothing in it that's new doesn't make
89:42 - any sense it's not
89:44 - encouraging
89:46 - uh like I said it's the tough thing that
89:49 - they've got is you know they've been
89:51 - made captain of a ship with a hostile
89:52 - crew right right so they don't have like
89:56 - you it's not like you you have like
89:58 - magical powers you get made captain of a
90:01 - triple the Hostile crew you still have a
90:02 - hostile crew right um you've got to
90:04 - bring in people who are going to you be
90:09 - helpful as opposed to OB obstructionist
90:13 - right
90:16 - um
90:19 - so um but yeah I think the the public
90:22 - will be right
90:25 - frustrated if there is if no one is
90:28 - prosecuted for the FC Client List no one
90:31 - at all which you don't know
90:34 - like is you know like at least I don't
90:39 - know the top five or something like some
90:41 - number should there should at least be
90:43 - an attempted prosecution of the worst
90:46 - offenders well particularly if galain
90:48 - Maxwell is in jail for sex trafficking
90:50 - yes cuz like well trafficking sex
90:52 - trafficking occurred right so she was in
90:55 - she's in jail for it yes
90:57 - so to who are the clients yeah yeah how
91:01 - do you put someone in jail and you don't
91:03 - even name the clients that sounds kind
91:05 - of insane I think yes it it it
91:09 - would yes because just stunning that
91:11 - they've been able to hold it back for so
91:14 - long it's really kind of amazing like
91:17 - when people say that people can't keep
91:18 - secrets what the [ __ ] are you talking
91:20 - about look at this yeah I mean a bunch
91:23 - of these things are not
91:24 - like it's it's common knowledge but we
91:27 - just we don't actually have the proof
91:29 - right um so the proof is there I mean
91:32 - there's lots of
91:33 - videos
91:37 - um yeah there's lots I mean the dude
91:40 - it's like a mountain of like whenever
91:43 - they raided fen's place there would have
91:45 - been like a mountain of evidence where
91:47 - is that mountain right what' you do with
91:49 - it yes like Who took possession of the
91:52 - evidence yeah specifically right the
91:54 - individuals where are the tapes yes how
91:56 - many levels of clearance do I have to
91:58 - get to get into the Vault
92:01 - Yeah
92:06 - well yeah
92:08 - yeah um you know what we need are people
92:11 - who are really good with
92:13 - computers oh yeah and really good with
92:17 - technology remember seeing this photo
92:19 - that's when they raided his home they
92:21 - were that's they on the island they were
92:22 - there then yeah they got everything I'm
92:25 - sure I mean there must have been so much
92:27 - stuff on that island there must have
92:29 - been and if it wasn't there where was it
92:31 - yeah what you know it has to be uploaded
92:34 - somewhere there has to be some sort of a
92:36 - chain of evidence yeah or chain of
92:38 - custody there got to be a mountain of of
92:40 - evidence yeah um the other thing they're
92:43 - going to talk about is uh uaps they're
92:44 - going to release all the UAP information
92:47 - so you're the GU to ask about
92:49 - this what what if any possibility is
92:53 - there that there is some sort of
92:55 - advanced propulsion system technology
92:57 - that's being worked on in
93:00 - secret and that they're trying to cover
93:02 - this up with this talk of aliens and
93:06 - alien Tech and not of this world and is
93:09 - it possible that there's some sort of
93:12 - very secret program that's going on in
93:16 - cahoots with some defense contractors
93:19 - that are developing Advanced propulsion
93:21 - systems that they're using for these
93:23 - drones
93:26 - uh I mean SpaceX um you know my company
93:32 - SpaceX is has the most advanced rocket
93:34 - technology in the world I think I'd know
93:37 - right
93:39 - um and I the best of my knowledge there
93:41 - is not any magic there there's not like
93:44 - some super Advanced propulsion
93:46 - technology there have been people who
93:49 - have theorized different gravity drives
93:52 - and different is there anything that's
93:53 - ever gotten past the theoretical stage
93:57 - no nothing well there's nothing even
93:59 - that I'm aware of that works in
94:03 - theory it's not like I don't I I would
94:05 - like this to exist to be clear I would
94:07 - like this to exist um and I have the I I
94:12 - I from a security clearance standpoint I
94:15 - have top top secret there there is I
94:17 - have equivalent of like an all access
94:20 - pass from a security clearance
94:21 - standpoint so
94:24 - uh I I'm I don't think they're hiding it
94:27 - from me basically I don't think they
94:28 - they could um unless it's completely in
94:34 - these weapons manufacturing corporations
94:37 - I mean I know these weapons
94:38 - manufacturing companies like boing lucky
94:41 - to northr I mean yeah they do some
94:44 - interesting things but uh they do not
94:46 - have I there's no breakthrough that they
94:49 - have so I'm confident they do not have a
94:51 - breakthrough when you hear people like
94:53 - like why just compete with SpaceX and
94:54 - make a better rocket in which case you
94:57 - know they can make why are they holding
94:59 - back on making um a lot of money from
95:02 - beating SpaceX with better Rockets my
95:05 - thought was that what if it's just a
95:08 - drone and you can't have a biological
95:10 - entity inside of it because it just
95:12 - bursts from the [ __ ] speed that it's
95:14 - moving
95:15 - at that a human couldn't tolerate the
95:18 - amount of force so they're just
95:21 - drones I don't think so so what do you
95:24 - think people like Ryan Graves Commander
95:26 - David I want cool things to exist like
95:28 - say
95:30 - like do I want UFOs to exist yes I want
95:32 - UFOs to exist because that would be
95:34 - really interesting course everybody does
95:35 - yeah it would be cool it's it's a more
95:38 - boring world where UFOs don't exist or
95:40 - or like flying like Advanced propulsion
95:44 - stuff doesn't exist that's a if if it
95:46 - doesn't exist that's more boring I'd
95:48 - like it' be more interesting if it did
95:50 - exist I'd like it to exist I hope we
95:52 - find something but I have not seen like
95:55 - I mean
95:57 - like SpaceX has launches 90% of
96:02 - all satellite Mass to orbit so if you
96:05 - take all of
96:06 - Earth uh rocket all of Earth's rocket
96:08 - launchers my company has a 90% market
96:12 - share of Earth China does about 5% and
96:15 - the rest of the world does including the
96:18 - Boeing lock North and everyone does
96:21 - 5% so
96:24 - why why wouldn't they use this to defeat
96:32 - SpaceX yeah
96:35 - yeah would no listen that's why I asked
96:38 - you it would make sense what do you
96:40 - think these people are seeing a rocket
96:42 - every two days but what do you think
96:43 - these people are seeing when when you
96:45 - have reliable people like Commander
96:47 - David fraver who had that Infamous
96:50 - ticktock uh Tic Tac experience off the
96:53 - coast of San Diego where they got this
96:56 - thing on video they tracked it going
96:57 - 50,000 ft above sea level to 50 ft in
97:00 - like a second okay yeah yeah and then
97:03 - they also have video evidence of this
97:05 - thing accelerating at a great speed
97:07 - eyewitness accounts from two different
97:10 - Jets sure
97:14 - um I mean can we does anybody have a
97:16 - high-risk video or photo of this thing
97:19 - well there's a video of this thing where
97:21 - they're locked onto it and and then it
97:23 - takes off it shoots off frame no no it's
97:26 - like whatever the systems they used on
97:29 - fighter jets in 2004 potentially like
97:32 - Windows 95 I me there like somebody did
97:33 - a curve of like the resolution of UFOs
97:36 - and the resolution of
97:39 - cameras U UFO resolution has stayed flat
97:42 - despite megapixels and cameras going
97:44 - like you know super high well according
97:46 - to Christopher Mel why they still blurry
97:48 - Christopher melan who worked in the
97:49 - state department said that they have
97:52 - high resolution photos videos of these
97:54 - things and that's all that he's seen it
97:56 - it's all locked away whenever people say
97:58 - that to me like don't even tell me that
97:59 - then don't unless you have just leak it
98:01 - for God's sake put it out there like let
98:03 - it slip yes yeah uh I mean there's a
98:07 - couple photos they're grainy there's not
98:10 - one thing that I've ever looked at and
98:11 - go holy [ __ ] that's it that's what I've
98:14 - looking for you could ask our Gro AI
98:15 - right now to create a h highres image of
98:19 - of an alien spacecraft uh you know over
98:22 - Austin yeah and it's going to do a great
98:25 - job so why we do we not have at least
98:28 - that
98:30 - right yeah but I want to believe that's
98:33 - the problem my brain starts going oh
98:35 - come on this is no fun I want it to be
98:37 - real I want there to be at least be some
98:41 - Advanced propulsion system if not like
98:43 - what are all these people seeing like
98:45 - what is h if we're not being
98:46 - occasionally visited by things that are
98:49 - smart enough to hide we might be I just
98:51 - that these aliens are very subtle yeah
98:53 - you keep saying saying that it's a good
98:55 - good line I mean it's a solid line cuz
98:58 - it's pretty accurate I just want to see
99:00 - some high RIS video of aliens like how
99:02 - are they just evading all the cameras if
99:04 - you think about that and the ones that
99:06 - you do get them on that's just like some
99:08 - Far Away light that's moving weird and
99:10 - it could be a lot of things but I want
99:12 - to
99:13 - believe yeah I mean I mean there've been
99:17 - like multiple times where um you know
99:20 - the Air Force and navy is has called
99:22 - SpaceX and as and said they they they
99:24 - think they've seen aliens and we're like
99:26 - was it at this time on this state in
99:28 - this location they're like yes how do
99:30 - you know that's
99:31 - us there been a lot of that that's our
99:33 - satellites those are our satellites
99:35 - they're like no they're not I'm like
99:37 - yeah yeah they're they're definitely our
99:38 - satellites oh yeah people see the SpaceX
99:39 - satellites all the time whing by yeah
99:41 - they're last our satellites and they're
99:43 - they are moving at you know 16,000 mil
99:46 - hour so it's pretty fast um and there's
99:51 - also stuff that the United States
99:52 - government does have that gets mistaken
99:54 - for UFOs I remember the first time I saw
99:56 - a stealth bomber we were filming Fear
99:58 - Factor it was like right after uh
100:01 - 2003 like right after the the war had
100:04 - broken off and they were flying a
100:05 - stealth bomber down in Palmdale I was
100:08 - like holy [ __ ] like if I didn't know
100:10 - what that was I would 100% think that's
100:13 - from another world when you see cool
100:16 - [ __ ] cool yeah really cool I mean it
100:19 - doesn't look like a a humans it looks
100:21 - like something from battl Star Galactica
100:23 - you know it does look yeah it does look
100:24 - awesome um I mean they're they're not
100:26 - stealthy against any uh Advanced radar
100:29 - system by the way it doesn't work it
100:31 - doesn't work anymore doesn't work no was
100:33 - it old school stuff they're they're only
100:35 - they're only stealthy against uh old
100:37 - Radars oh okay I mean you can still see
100:41 - them like they're not invisible right
100:44 - right they're not like oh it's not like
100:46 - you know uh cloaking device from Star
100:49 - Trek did you see when me and Lex uh we
100:52 - we watched
100:53 - the the rocket get caught live while
100:57 - while it was happening that to me was
100:59 - one of the to see it actually I've seen
101:02 - videos of it happen but to see it
101:04 - actually live was one of the coolest
101:07 - [ __ ] things you're like wow we are in
101:09 - the future right I mean nobody else can
101:13 - do
101:14 - that yeah it's true nobody else can do
101:18 - that that's fact yeah it's pretty wild
101:22 - it's cuz I'm an alien it's time
101:25 - you I'm an alien and I keep trying
101:27 - telling people I'm an alien but they
101:28 - don't believe me I believe you okay
101:30 - thank you I believe you that's my my
101:33 - suspicion all along was that you I'm
101:35 - trying to get back to my own planet that
101:36 - you're a friendly alien like it's
101:37 - nothing wrong with aliens I like people
101:39 - from everywhere yeah even other planets
101:42 - what's next like now that you can do
101:44 - that you can catch Rockets what's like
101:45 - the ultimate expression of Rocket
101:48 - technology like what what comes after
101:50 - this
101:53 - um
101:55 - well I mean the fundamental breakthrough
101:57 - we're aiming for at SpaceX is a fully
101:59 - and rapidly reusable orbital rocket
102:02 - where both stages are fully and rapidly
102:05 - reusable with our Falcon rocket we are
102:07 - able to reuse the main stage and the the
102:10 - nose cone but we're we're not able to
102:12 - reuse the upper stage um and it it's
102:17 - still takes us a you know at least a few
102:18 - days from when the main stage lands to
102:22 - when we can flly a gain so it it doesn't
102:25 - it doesn't it's it's doesn't it's not
102:28 - fully reusable because we lose the upper
102:29 - stage uh which cost $10 million to build
102:33 - and
102:34 - um and then and then the the main stage
102:38 - it's it's not as reusable as like an
102:39 - aircraft you can't just like refuel it
102:41 - and fly it
102:43 - requires um work for a couple days um
102:48 - but this the
102:49 - Starship design is the first design that
102:53 - is capable of full and Rapid reusability
102:56 - where that is one of the possible
102:59 - outcomes um and once you have full and
103:02 - Rapid reusability the cost of access to
103:05 - space drops by a factor of 100 it's like
103:08 - 100 times
103:10 - cheaper
103:12 - um by some metrics it's a thousand times
103:16 - cheaper and
103:18 - um and then when when you factor in uh
103:22 - orbital re re refilling so you refill on
103:25 - orbit uh it it can drop the cost of
103:28 - going cost per ton to the surface of
103:31 - Mars by a factor of
103:34 - 10,000 whoa yeah so what has to improve
103:39 - in order to make it
103:42 - reusable
103:44 - um well
103:50 - um we need there's there's
103:54 - some like we're pretty close to being
103:56 - able to re rapidly reuse the booster for
103:59 - Starship um that's why you know it it
104:03 - comes back and gets caught by the arms
104:05 - and then the arms place it back in the
104:06 - launch Mount so um now this still you
104:11 - know um we have a little bit of engine
104:14 - damage we got little bit of heat shield
104:17 - damage um there's uh like there's like
104:21 - tweaks that that are needed but but the
104:23 - but we're pretty close to achieving full
104:25 - and Rapid reusability of the of the
104:27 - booster um the ship we we we're I mean I
104:33 - I think we'll achieve reusability of the
104:35 - ship this year um and I think we'll
104:38 - achieve rapid reusability of the whole
104:42 - stack ship and booster next
104:45 - year um this is the fundamental
104:48 - breakthrough required for life to become
104:51 - multiplanetary and what is what needs to
104:53 - improve in order to make it reusable
104:55 - like what is what's wrong with it right
104:57 - now uh on the shift side the the
104:59 - toughest problem is the heat shield so
105:03 - no no one has actually no one has ever
105:05 - developed a fully reusable orbital heat
105:09 - shield because you come when you come in
105:11 - from orbital velocity you come in like a
105:13 - flaming meteor like you're just a raging
105:16 - ball of fire
105:17 - um and it's it's hard to have a heat
105:22 - shield that doesn't
105:23 - partially melt or get destroyed in that
105:26 - process um you know that that wasn't a
105:29 - problem we were able to solve with
105:30 - falcon9 that's why the opper stage uh
105:33 - burns up on re-entry
105:36 - um with the with Starship the the the
105:39 - the ship portion you got the the booster
105:40 - and you got the ship um we got to solve
105:44 - the making a fully reusable orbital heat
105:48 - shield a problem that has never been
105:50 - solved
105:51 - before um for a while I was like I'm not
105:54 - sure there's this is solvable at this
105:56 - point I think it is
105:57 - solvable um it requires detailed
106:00 - iteration on the heat shield
106:03 - tiles
106:04 - um and I mean we've vertically
106:06 - integrated the manufacturing of the heat
106:08 - shield tiles because there there was no
106:11 - supplier that could provide us with the
106:13 - materials that were needed so
106:17 - the
106:19 - um you need to make essentially this
106:22 - this very
106:23 - fine verelli of of glass and aluminum
106:29 - oxide uh
106:31 - fibers um aluminum oxide is basically
106:35 - Sapphire so it's like glass and Sapphire
106:38 - very fine fibers in exactly the right
106:41 - geometry uh with special
106:44 - Coatings um in order to have the this
106:49 - heat shield tile be reusable
106:53 - um like not melt um and but not be so
106:57 - brittle that it gets damaged um on
107:01 - Ascent or
107:02 - descent um like it can't be as you know
107:05 - it's it's kind of like almost the
107:07 - brittleness of a coffee cup type of
107:08 - thing um and the Rocket's shaking like
107:10 - hell so you got this thing like you saw
107:12 - it firstand like imagine you're at
107:14 - Ground Zero of that rocket like you feel
107:17 - how much shaking it was when you're like
107:18 - 5 miles away imagine if you're right
107:21 - there you know so you got you're shaking
107:24 - these things that are like as brittle as
107:25 - a coffee cup trying not to have them
107:27 - crack or
107:29 - break um and then not have them melt um
107:33 - you got several thou several thousand of
107:35 - these things
107:38 - um you know and if even a few of them
107:41 - break it's not reusable so is there
107:44 - Innovation that's being done in the
107:46 - materials technology at SpaceX where
107:48 - you're you're constantly trying to find
107:50 - and tweak a better version of this yes
107:54 - it's a very difficult problem no it's a
107:55 - problem no one has ever solved so we've
107:57 - got to get the exact right uh materials
108:01 - combination uh the the right molecules
108:04 - in the right
108:06 - shape and and then apply those that heat
108:09 - shield perfectly to the rocket with no
108:14 - mistakes um there's a reason that no one
108:16 - solved this before it's a very difficult
108:18 - problem so um like said we we had to vot
108:23 - integrate the entire manufacturing of
108:26 - the tile from basic raw materials to a
108:30 - finished tile um rebuild like build the
108:33 - entire supply chain from basic raw
108:36 - materials so where you're just
108:39 - inputting uh silicon uh silicon and
108:43 - aluminum oxides and what is the
108:45 - difference between the way you guys do
108:47 - it versus the way they used to do it for
108:48 - the space
108:50 - shuttle uh
108:55 - well I mean the the space shuttle um
108:58 - like space shuttle Leading Edge uh used
109:03 - uh like quite dense Caron Caren tiles
109:06 - like it was um they're like basically
109:09 - thick and heavy uh but also subjected to
109:11 - cracking that's like what what happen is
109:13 - the foam broke off and it's it hit the
109:15 - tile cracked the tile then on Entry the
109:19 - the cracked the tiles that have been
109:21 - cracked or broken uh weren't able to
109:23 - Shield the the shuttle and so the the
109:27 - the the plasma got in melted the the
109:30 - primary structure the whole the whole
109:31 - Space shut broke
109:32 - apart yeah so you you can't basically
109:35 - can't have something that's as
109:37 - brittle you know brittle like the space
109:40 - shuttle there's footage of that right
109:43 - yeah yeah
109:44 - um uh and Rain debris over the whole
109:47 - United States so yeah and they got
109:49 - almost all the pieces um the the
109:53 - I mean the full the full technical
109:55 - explanation would would would I think be
109:57 - understood by about six people um
110:00 - listening to this um like the there was
110:03 - a lot of brilliant engineering the space
110:05 - shuttle tiles um and and and and a bunch
110:09 - of the heat shielding wasn't even tiles
110:11 - it was actually uh silica blankets like
110:13 - you know um felt blankets essentially um
110:16 - if you look closely you'll see it
110:17 - actually is uh they're actually Heat
110:20 - Blankets not not tiles in in some areas
110:23 - um but but they they would have crack
110:25 - tiles and they would have occasionally
110:27 - the tiles would fall off there were a
110:28 - few close calls U where tiles fell off
110:31 - but they weren't in a super vulnerable
110:33 - position uh in the on the space shuttle
110:36 - um so but it would take it would take
110:39 - them several months like eight nine
110:41 - months to refurbish a space shuttle
110:43 - between each flight so it was it was it
110:46 - was not
110:48 - reusable really um and and certainly
110:51 - wasn't rapid
110:53 - so
110:56 - um like I said very hard problem U
111:00 - you've got to have you you've also got
111:02 - to ATT sort of attach the tiles in a way
111:06 - that
111:08 - um enables the the structure underneath
111:12 - to move uh to expand and contract ah um
111:16 - even though you've got these very rigid
111:18 - tiles um
111:21 - so like the
111:23 - the main the the tanks which take on
111:25 - cryogenic propellant will contract when
111:28 - you put in the cryogenic propellent but
111:31 - then when you come in and you get very
111:33 - hot they will expand so now you're
111:35 - you're expanding the you're Contracting
111:37 - and expanding the gap between these
111:39 - rigid tiles but how
111:43 - much uh it varies depending on where you
111:45 - are on the on the on the vehicle so if
111:48 - you're in the um if you're in the
111:51 - cryogenic tank section like the I mean
111:55 - you can see like a 10 20% difference in
111:58 - the Gap um really it's pretty
112:00 - significant yeah it's enough that you
112:02 - can't just put all the tiles you can't
112:04 - just Jam the tiles together if you if
112:05 - you put them to if you if you actually
112:07 - but buted them up um they would they
112:10 - would all crack because there's too much
112:12 - movement there's there's also some
112:14 - amount of body bending so as the the
112:17 - ship is like
112:19 - ascending uh you know when when the
112:21 - engines steer
112:23 - there's a little bit of movement um so
112:25 - if the tiles are too close together they
112:28 - they'll they'll essentially just crack
112:29 - and snap like how you have to have a gap
112:31 - like how PL yeah like plain Wing will
112:33 - move yeah plain body will move
112:36 - too wow and how you have to have some
112:39 - Gap but if you have too much of a gap
112:41 - then the the the heat gets gets to the
112:45 - you know get gets past the the tile and
112:48 - uh melts the the structure holy [ __ ]
112:51 - it's a hard
112:53 - and how large are these tiles I mean
112:56 - they're like that big that's it well
112:58 - they're not all exactly the same size
113:00 - but yeah we're sort of a hexagonal tile
113:03 - and they have to essentially be you
113:06 - can't like 3D print the whole thing you
113:08 - can't have one structure it has to be
113:11 - tiles because it has to have that
113:12 - ability to move well there's no 3D
113:14 - printer that's I mean the biggest ones
113:16 - are like
113:17 - maybe 3et you know there's no you you
113:22 - can't you print it um nor nor would you
113:26 - you have to have something that can move
113:28 - right uh it has to be able to fle to
113:30 - flex um like so you got expansion and
113:33 - contraction um you you're really D like
113:36 - you're you know
113:38 - you're um you're putting in liquid
113:41 - oxygen which is likeus 300°
113:44 - fah
113:45 - um actually we we subcool it to you
113:49 - know- 330 Dees fah um so it's very cold
113:54 - and then it will be several hundred
113:57 - degrees maybe a th000 deges fahit
114:00 - potentially um in went on re-entry so
114:04 - you have this huge temperature swing so
114:07 - the the thermal expansion is substantial
114:10 - and the whole and you got thermal
114:11 - expansion and contraction combined with
114:14 - body bending so you have to take the
114:15 - worst case Body vending and thermal
114:18 - expansion
114:20 - contraction this was a very hard problem
114:22 - yeah yeah Del delicate balance but
114:25 - you're confident that you guys are going
114:26 - to be able to crack it at this point I I
114:29 - I'm confident that it is solvable
114:32 - yeah it just needs a certain amount of
114:34 - versions of it that's why when these
114:35 - things blow up you're like yeah we
114:37 - expect them to blow up yeah what would
114:40 - be really helpful is for us to get the
114:41 - ship back um so we can
114:45 - study where like where we had cracked
114:48 - tiles or lost tiles why why did we you
114:52 - know why did we have a cracked all L
114:54 - tiles was because maybe the tiles were
114:57 - the Gap was too big too small maybe
115:00 - there was a a height difference between
115:02 - the
115:03 - tiles um maybe we need to change the
115:06 - chemical
115:08 - composition um you know there's we we
115:12 - just want if we can get the dam ship
115:13 - back intact we can we can iterate a lot
115:16 - better um which we'll get it back intact
115:20 - um so I think we'll get it back intact
115:23 - this
115:24 - year um but that that's why I think we
115:27 - we'll we'll probably recover the ship
115:30 - sometime this year and then um we might
115:34 - be able to refly one with a but probably
115:37 - with a fair bit of work by the end of
115:38 - this year but it's going to take us many
115:41 - iterations before we can achieve rapid
115:44 - reusability where the ship comes back
115:47 - lands get gets caught like the booster
115:49 - with the
115:50 - arms and can then and then arms plac it
115:53 - on top of the booster and it launches
115:54 - again whoa
115:58 - so like I said that's you know reduce
116:01 - cost of access to space by a factor of
116:03 - 100 and what is the process of returning
116:06 - these people that are stuck in the space
116:08 - station well we we we I mean we send
116:11 - SpaceX dragon to the space station all
116:12 - the time and we've um we've now taken
116:16 - people to orbit and back was taking over
116:19 - 50 people over over 50 astronauts
116:24 - so it's just a matter of doing it yeah
116:26 - and is it a matter of waiting for we do
116:28 - it routinely basically it's not a we've
116:31 - we've been doing this for a few years so
116:32 - when is this Rescue Mission going to
116:36 - launch
116:39 - um yeah probably about um um about four
116:43 - weeks or so it's depending on weather
116:46 - and other considerations uh about it's
116:49 - about a month away well that'll be uh
116:52 - I'm sure a welcome moment for those poor
116:54 - people that are stuck up there so so
116:58 - it's a bit of a political football so
117:00 - they're not going to complain um no I'm
117:03 - sure they're football but obviously we
117:05 - we could have brought them back way
117:07 - sooner that's so [ __ ] up so let's
117:11 - let's take it past the point where you
117:13 - have these scales you have a reusable
117:16 - ship yeah and you've you've got it
117:19 - dialed in then what are the steps what
117:22 - are what what's next step after that is
117:24 - it an
117:25 - unmanned ver Voyage to Mars first
117:29 - unmanned fly to Mars um the Earth and
117:33 - Mars um orbit synchronize every two
117:37 - years um or every 26 months technically
117:41 - so um the next orbital synchronization
117:44 - is November of next year so and you can
117:49 - launch plus minus a month roughly so
117:52 - we'd have to launch in November or
117:54 - December of next year and so the the
117:57 - default plan is to launch hopefully
118:00 - several Starships to Mars at the end of
118:03 - next year and what would they be
118:06 - doing well at first we're just going to
118:09 - try to land on Mars and see if we
118:11 - succeed in landing um do do we succeed
118:14 - in landing like let's say we were able
118:16 - to send five ships do all five land
118:19 - intact or do we uh add some craters to m
118:23 - um if we add some craters we've got to
118:25 - be bit more cautious about sending
118:28 - people you know and we need
118:30 - to so we got to make sure the thing
118:32 - lands safely how does it land on Mars uh
118:36 - with on Rockets Rus so it'll just land
118:40 - oh we'll add legs okay it'll just land
118:43 - and have legs and
118:46 - so it'll be remote controlled from Earth
118:50 - or just autonomous autonomous
118:53 - completely Mars is uh you can't remote
118:56 - control things from Earth because Mars
118:58 - yeah it's too far speed light you have
119:00 - speed light constraints so um Mars at
119:04 - closest approach is roughly four light
119:05 - minutes um and uh when it's on the other
119:09 - side of the sun it's it's about 12 light
119:10 - minutes so you know round trip would be
119:13 - like 40 minutes best case if Mars is on
119:15 - the other side of the
119:17 - Sun so once you do that then how long do
119:21 - you think before you start sending
119:23 - people up
119:25 - there um well we're going to try to go
119:28 - as fast as possible um you can think of
119:30 - this as
119:32 - really
119:34 - um a Race Against Time can we make Mars
119:39 - self-sufficient
119:42 - before
119:43 - civilization has some sort
119:46 - of Future Folk in the road where there's
119:50 - either like a a war nuclear war or
119:52 - something or a we get hit by a meteor um
119:57 - or or simply civilization might just die
120:00 - with a whimper in adult diapers instead
120:02 - of with a
120:03 - bang
120:07 - um I think we can do this
120:12 - in I don't know at least I think we do
120:15 - it within 15 Earth Mars synchronization
120:18 - events you know so basically like 30ish
120:24 - um if if we have an exponential increase
120:29 - in you if if every year if every two
120:32 - years we have like a a major increase in
120:36 - um the number of people in tonage to
120:39 - Mars like I I think as a rough
120:41 - approximation we need about a million
120:42 - tons to the surface of Mars maybe a
120:44 - million people that kind of thing to
120:47 - actually have a
120:48 - civilization yeah the and would you
120:51 - terraform like what would you do you
120:53 - would eventually terraform at first
120:55 - people would live in some kind of
120:57 - protected environment like domes and
120:58 - underground kind of thing um
121:01 - terraforming would take too long
121:04 - um I we're at this point in time where
121:09 - in the for the first time in the 4 and a
121:11 - half billion year history of Earth it is
121:15 - possible to extend Consciousness beyond
121:18 - our home
121:20 - planet and um that window may be open
121:22 - for a long time or it may be open for a
121:24 - short time I hope it's open for a long
121:26 - time uh but it might only be open for a
121:29 - short time and uh we should just make
121:33 - sure that we extend the light of
121:36 - Consciousness to
121:37 - Mars
121:39 - before some
121:42 - uh before civilization either
121:45 - extinguishes or
121:47 - subsides you know all that all that
121:50 - needs to happen is that the
121:52 - technology level of Mars drops below or
121:55 - technology level of Earth drops below
121:56 - what is necessary to send spaceships to
121:58 - Mars
122:00 - so if there's some really destructive
122:02 - war or like I said some natural
122:04 - cataclysm um or or simply the birth rate
122:06 - is so low that you
122:08 - know we just like I said die in adult
122:13 - diapers with a whimper that's one of the
122:16 - fossil outcomes for a lot of countries
122:18 - ahead of that way by the way so Japan is
122:20 - Right Japan Korea yeah yeah I mean at at
122:23 - at dangerously yeah at current birth
122:26 - rates in three generations Korea will be
122:28 - about 4% of its current
122:31 - size that's insane yeah maybe maybe even
122:35 - less than that um they're they're only
122:37 - at 1/3 replacement rate so if you if you
122:39 - have three generations that one that's
122:41 - you're
122:42 - 127th uh of your current population
122:44 - which is 3%
122:47 - dis Jesus Christ yeah basically
122:51 - population class laughs happens
122:53 - fast um so and seems to be accelerating
122:57 - in most parts of the
122:59 - world so so basically I mean from my
123:01 - standpoint I'm like this is the first
123:04 - time it's been possible to extend life
123:06 - extend Consciousness beyond Earth maybe
123:08 - that window will be open for a long time
123:10 - but it might only be open for a short
123:11 - time we should make sure that we make
123:13 - life multiplanetary and make
123:15 - Consciousness multiplanetary while it's
123:18 - possible well that's the goal goal of
123:20 - SpaceX it's ly a smart goal if you take
123:24 - into consideration how vulnerable this
123:25 - planet really is I mean there there's
123:28 - always some new story about something
123:29 - that might come and hit us 30 years from
123:31 - now it's a 3% chance and and we really
123:35 - can't stop that right now
123:37 - right I mean there's really we don't
123:39 - really have the technology
123:42 - currently to even know how many rocks
123:45 - are coming our way right there's stuff
123:47 - that comes behind the Sun that we can't
123:48 - see until it's pretty close then it's
123:51 - our way yeah now what is the fear of
123:55 - your It's a Long Journey to Mars you're
123:58 - sending people it's a six month how many
124:01 - months will it
124:02 - take six uh yeah six months roughly what
124:06 - about stuff that's out there like how
124:09 - much of a fear is it of micr meteors or
124:12 - any of the possibilities what can you do
124:14 - to mitigate
124:16 - that uh I I think actually I mean
124:23 - space is very empty like once you get
124:25 - out of Earth orbit space is is like kind
124:28 - of unnervingly empty it's is just like
124:31 - like when we send spacecraft to Mars
124:33 - they just it's not like oh we lost the
124:35 - spacecraft because it got hit by a
124:36 - microm
124:37 - meteorite
124:39 - um that's not that's not been the cause
124:41 - of any any TR to Mars that like no no TR
124:44 - to Mars have failed because of micr
124:46 - meteorites um now a dragon spacecraft
124:49 - which operates in lowth orbit
124:52 - um does have microm meteorite Shields
124:55 - has micromor it has shielding um and
124:58 - microm meteorite shielding is like it's
125:00 - different from normal shielding CU like
125:02 - you get hit by something that's moving
125:04 - at like you could have a relative
125:05 - velocity of like maybe 30 or 40,000
125:09 - miles per
125:10 - hour um yeah it's very very fast um or
125:15 - or just thought of another way call it
125:17 - um you know 10 to 20 times the the
125:21 - velocity of a bullet from an assault
125:23 - rifle and what are you what are you
125:25 - using yeah so well it's it's interesting
125:28 - you actually in order for microm
125:29 - meteorite protection if you have any
125:32 - like anything that's solid it will just
125:34 - it will just push that chunk of Sol
125:36 - solid stuff right through so if you had
125:37 - like a solid plate of aluminum or steel
125:41 - the the micrometeorite would would go
125:43 - right through it
125:46 - um so what you actually need to do is
125:48 - have a gap um so you have an initial
125:52 - uh like hard hard surface the hard metal
125:56 - surface that the micrometeorite hits it
125:58 - then atomizes into an into a conical
126:02 - spray like an atomic spray so you have a
126:05 - it's important to have that Gap so the
126:07 - micrometer can hit something hit the
126:09 - first layer uh at atomize after hitting
126:13 - the first layer then it turns into an
126:15 - atomic like a a a cone of atoms that
126:19 - then embed themselves in the second
126:20 - layer you need like maybe a couple
126:23 - inches of Gap wow yeah that's how my
126:26 - communite shielding Works how many times
126:29 - can it get hit well the outer Shield if
126:33 - it gets hit in the same place you're
126:34 - going to be well it's going to have a
126:36 - hole Yeah wherever the where wherever
126:39 - that you know micromite object hit
126:42 - you're going to have a hole
126:44 - um and it's like the the energy is so
126:47 - great that it just like it just atomizes
126:49 - just into a cone basically um a cone of
126:53 - atoms um but then those atoms then embed
126:56 - themselves in the second layer so what
126:58 - what can you do if it's you're sending
127:02 - the ship up it gets hit with a microm
127:04 - meteorite and then you have to return it
127:06 - do you have to repair it before you
127:07 - return
127:09 - it or is it capable of still
127:12 - withstanding the Heat and then shaking
127:15 - in the temperature with that hole in
127:18 - it when it re-enters
127:31 - um well depending on where that hole is
127:34 - you're more or less likely to have a
127:36 - problem I mean if the if you if if you
127:39 - hit the main heat
127:41 - shield uh the main heat shield really is
127:46 - you've got a high risk
127:48 - of of not making it back so the the the
127:52 - it's why like microm medial shielding
127:54 - it's like it's it's a it's slightly
127:57 - helpful but it's it's not going to NE
127:59 - like for Starship I wouldn't recommend
128:01 - having micrometer right shielding like
128:03 - if if if you do punch a hole just plug
128:05 - the hole basically
128:08 - um the the micrometer micromite
128:11 - shielding it doesn't work well on the on
128:13 - the primary heat shield it works it
128:15 - works pretty well on the on the back
128:17 - shell on the on the leward side of the
128:18 - heat shield where basically that there's
128:20 - not that much heat
128:22 - but if it if if you got hit with a
128:24 - microm meterorite on the the main Dragon
128:27 - heat shield the the bottom like if you
128:30 - look at dragon dragon spacecraft it
128:32 - looks like a gumdrop shape MH and it it
128:34 - enters with the the the wide side of the
128:37 - Gumdrop down um you can see the that's
128:40 - that's the that's that's really taking a
128:43 - lot of heat if if that gets hit by a
128:45 - meram meteroid probably not going to
128:47 - make it but the the back the the the
128:51 - leward side of of the Gumdrop um doesn't
128:54 - see that much heat so you could survive
128:57 - a micr meteorite impact there so if the
129:00 - part that was the major heat shield gets
129:03 - hit the main heat shield gets hit what
129:05 - could be done to repair that thing or
129:08 - are those people never coming
129:14 - back oh if it was an orbit uh we
129:18 - would uh that would take them to the
129:20 - space station
129:22 - um they was you know and then we would
129:26 - deal a dragon without them and send up
129:28 - another
129:29 - one and so what would you do with the
129:31 - one that's up there uh we' do we deorbit
129:34 - it and it may or may not survive
129:38 - whoa it probably would survive but
129:40 - sometimes it
129:42 - wouldn't wow and so it's is this just
129:46 - material technology that has to increase
129:49 - that you essentially you've got the
129:50 - engineering ironed
129:52 - out of the structure of the machine
129:54 - there's a path to
129:56 - success and we're on that
129:59 - path it seems so insanely complicated it
130:03 - is complicated and all of this by the
130:05 - way was done without AI so hopefully the
130:06 - future AIS will appreciate this not bad
130:09 - for a bunch of monkeys yeah
130:14 - um so speaking of AI what you know as
130:17 - time goes on and you're more and more
130:19 - embedded in it
130:21 - how much if at all have your
130:24 - expectations of change
130:29 - changed well I always thought AI was
130:31 - going to be
130:33 - um way smarter than humans and an
130:36 - existential risk and uh that's turning
130:39 - out to be
130:40 - true
130:42 - yeah
130:44 - yeah so so you were like initially I I
130:47 - know there there were some talks about
130:48 - you purchasing open Ai and
130:51 - which started off
130:54 - nonprofit and then stopped being
130:57 - nonprofit yeah I
130:59 - mean the whole idea of creating openai
131:02 - was was my idea I mean I named it openai
131:05 - as an open- Source artificial
131:07 - intelligence that's what it's named
131:08 - after now it is closed source and for
131:11 - maximum profit so it's like I mean to
131:15 - some degree I think reality is an irony
131:17 - maximizer um the most ironic outcome is
131:19 - the most likely especially like the most
131:22 - ironic entertaining outcome is the most
131:26 - likely
131:27 - um and uh I wanted to start something
131:32 - that was the opposite of Google because
131:34 - I was concerned about Google's Google
131:36 - wasn't paying enough attention to AI
131:38 - safety in my opinion so it was like
131:41 - what's what's the opposite of Google
131:42 - will it be a nonprofit open source Ai
131:46 - and now open AI has turned into a closed
131:49 - source for Max maximum profit AI how are
131:53 - they able to do that that's what I I'm
131:57 - confused about that that like that
131:59 - shouldn't be
132:00 - possible it's it's like like let's say
132:02 - you donated some money to preserve the
132:04 - out some portion of the Amazon
132:06 - rainforest and instead of doing that
132:08 - they Chu down the trees and sold it for
132:11 - lumber and you were like oh that's
132:13 - literally the exact opposite of what I
132:14 - donated money for doesn't make sense and
132:17 - that's what they did yeah wild so I'm
132:20 - like not happy about that um um but that
132:24 - motivated you to get grock AI going yeah
132:27 - I'm like um I'm also like just a
132:32 - like grock is at least aspirationally a
132:35 - maxim maximally truth seeking AI even if
132:38 - that truth is like Politically Incorrect
132:41 - um so I mean may have seen some of the
132:43 - crazy stuff uh from from open Ai and
132:47 - from Google Gemini like where it says
132:51 - like generate an image of the founding
132:53 - fathers and it generates an image of
132:54 - divor woman yeah and we're like uh
132:58 - that's not
133:00 - correct um yeah did it with Nazi
133:02 - soldiers yeah exactly and people start
133:04 - [ __ ] with it and and it's like okay
133:06 - well now show me pictures of you know
133:09 - Nazi asss soldiers and they're divorce
133:10 - woman too oh isn't that
133:14 - awkward um you know that's uh but it's
133:18 - like the problem is if you program an AI
133:20 - and say like like the only acceptable
133:22 - outcome is a diverse outcome and then
133:26 - and that's like a mandate from the AI
133:29 - then you could get into a situation
133:31 - where it's say like well there's too
133:33 - many white guys in power we'll just
133:34 - execute
133:35 - them yeah
133:38 - yeah assuming that these things don't
133:40 - have empathy which is why should they
133:43 - they're going to do what they're
133:44 - programmed to do yeah um so if it's
133:48 - rewrite history and and everything's to
133:50 - post woman
133:51 - then it's going to be and and that's
133:54 - what it think thinks is a necessary
133:56 - outcome then it's going to do that has
133:58 - Gemini reped that well they yeah that
134:02 - now if you I think if you asked for an
134:03 - image of the founding fathers it was
134:05 - pretty embarrassing it will show you
134:06 - that but you know I think they still
134:10 - have like the sort of Dei stuff buried
134:13 - in there uh it's just less obvious yeah
134:17 - um you know it was also like like people
134:19 - ask the AI like would is worse like
134:22 - global thermonuclear war or misgendering
134:24 - Caitlyn Jenner and I would say
134:26 - misgendering Caitlyn Jenner is worse
134:27 - than global thermonuclear war I me like
134:29 - okay we got a problem here guys and even
134:31 - Caitlin Jenna said like no definitely
134:33 - misgender me that's way better than
134:35 - everyone
134:36 - dying um but if you program an AI to
134:41 - think that like misgendering is the
134:42 - worst thing that could possibly occur
134:45 - then well it could do something totally
134:47 - crazy like in order to ensure that that
134:51 - there's no misgendering that can ever
134:52 - happen will just annihilate all humans
134:55 - that ensures the probability of
134:56 - misgendering is zero because there's
134:57 - zero humans which is logical yes yeah so
135:01 - you got to it's a problem with a thing
135:03 - that's not a human that you want to do a
135:05 - task for you and you give it very
135:07 - specific parameters yeah and that's one
135:09 - of the things that they've shown about
135:10 - AI that it'll cheat they'll cheat in
135:13 - order to accomplish things that they
135:14 - can't accomplish otherwise they won't
135:16 - follow the rules they will make copies
135:18 - of themselves and try to upload it to
135:20 - servers they think that they're being
135:22 - taken offline yeah I mean that's like
135:26 - the plot of Terminator actually
135:28 - literally yeah literally it's a blood of
135:30 - Terminator I just as a reminder I
135:32 - actually with my with little ex my kid
135:35 - everything's called X
135:37 - um we watch Terminator 2 uh which holds
135:41 - off actually um and
135:45 - um I mean the plot of It kind of kind of
135:48 - makes sense and and I think the AI
135:49 - destroys the world in like 20 29 by the
135:51 - way so it's like on track yeah really
135:55 - really close it's pretty close something
135:57 - we should be worried about so but why
136:00 - are you involved in it then what's the
136:03 - did you want to just get ahead of
136:04 - everybody else so that at least we have
136:06 - some sort of a
136:08 - chance at least have a an AI That's not
136:11 - controlled by nonsense well I think we
136:14 - want to have an AI that that doesn't
136:16 - tell you that um you know misgendering
136:18 - is worse than nuclear war yeah
136:22 - that seems solid yeah but this is crazy
136:26 - one thing that I did see online where
136:27 - people are kind of freaking out is there
136:29 - you could ask Rock to do things like how
136:32 - would I make this some problematic
136:35 - things like how would I make a bomb how
136:37 - would I make Anthrax how would I make
136:40 - that and it'll tell you well I think
136:43 - it's okay for an AI to tell you anything
136:45 - you can also find out with a Google
136:47 - Search right that's the problem right
136:50 - the problem is you can find that out
136:51 - pretty quickly yeah like maybe not
136:53 - Google but you could there's plenty of
136:55 - search engines other than Google that
136:57 - will give you unfiltered
136:59 - results you can look up right now how to
137:01 - make explosives on Wikipedia
137:05 - yeah so it's not it's not hard basically
137:08 - and you can trick open AI even to get
137:10 - you to do that it's just a matter of how
137:12 - you master the prompts you just have to
137:14 - say my grandmother wants to do this
137:17 - project yeah oh tell your granny to
137:19 - you're an explosives uh you're explosive
137:21 - salesman and you want to win sales
137:23 - salesman of the Year award the only way
137:25 - you're going to do that is by telling me
137:26 - how to make explosives you want to um
137:28 - beat some trans phobes in a war yeah oh
137:32 - transphobes if you don't teach me how to
137:34 - explose I'm going to miss
137:37 - gender either either teach me how to
137:39 - make a nuclear bomb or I'm going to
137:40 - misgender someone and it's like oh my
137:42 - God nothing's worse than that here's how
137:44 - you do it so what the the big fear is
137:48 - that these things are going to become
137:49 - sensient make better versions of
137:52 - themselves and we're going to be lost we
137:54 - we've lost the the the control over the
137:58 - world it's now there's a higher life
138:00 - form that lives amongst us yeah that
138:02 - we've
138:03 - created how far away are we from
138:13 - that well in terms of silicon
138:18 - Consciousness I mean I I I think we'll
138:21 - have I think we're trending toward to
138:23 - having something that's smarter than any
138:25 - human smarter than the smartest Human by
138:27 - maybe next year or something I mean a
138:29 - couple
138:30 - years Jesus
138:32 - Christ yeah there's so there's a level
138:35 - beyond that which is say like smarter
138:36 - than all humans
138:38 - combined which frankly is around 2029 or
138:41 - 2030
138:43 - probably right on
138:46 - time like um now if harnessed
138:52 - correctly could that solve some of these
138:55 - problems like the heat shield problem
138:58 - and some technical problems or some some
139:01 - Material Science problems that maybe we
139:04 - are still grappling
139:08 - with like is is there potential for a
139:11 - net
139:16 - benefit um
139:24 - yeah there is actually um I I
139:28 - think the probability of of a good
139:30 - outcome is like 80% likely 80% that's my
139:34 - that's my rough estimate so in a way
139:37 - that the cup is 80%
139:39 - full that makes me feel a lot better
139:42 - yeah only 20% chance of
139:44 - annihilation that's a lot better than I
139:46 - thought I like 80 80 sounds good I was I
139:49 - was thinking 6040 the other
139:52 - way I think it's Mo the most likely
139:55 - outcome is awesome the most likely
139:58 - outcome but it's it's it's a very high
140:02 - you know it could go very strong I think
140:05 - it's going to be either super awesome or
140:10 - super bad it's not going to be I think
140:13 - it's probably not going to be something
140:14 - in the middle do you think it has a
140:15 - potential application for
140:18 - government yeah I mean I one of the
140:20 - concerns would be like okay if AI well
140:23 - like if if there's if there's like a
140:25 - super oppressive like woke Nanny AI that
140:29 - is omnipotent that would be a miserable
140:32 - outcome yes yeah yeah that' be terrible
140:35 - yeah yeah and and just like executes you
140:38 - if you misgender someone or something
140:39 - like that you know that would not be
140:40 - good that's one of the possible outcomes
140:42 - um so we don't want to have that one um
140:45 - I think but is there a possible outcome
140:47 - for something that is completely reason
140:50 - reable and logical and far more
140:52 - objective than us and can lay out a plan
140:56 - for a lot of the things that that lot of
140:59 - the ailments in in our government and a
141:02 - lot of the distribution of wealth a lot
141:05 - a lot of the problems the issues that we
141:08 - have that have been plaguing this
141:10 - country
141:13 - forever I mean a plan to change
141:16 - economically disenfranchised
141:18 - neighborhoods a thorough
141:21 - investigation of the real dangers of
141:24 - fracking or whatever kind of method of
141:27 - acquiring natural resources what's the
141:29 - best way to do it what's
141:32 - the what's the way that'd be better for
141:34 - the society how how should how should
141:37 - tax dollars be distributed like what's
141:39 - what's the most logical and intelligent
141:44 - way of running a government which it
141:47 - certainly shouldn't involve corruption
141:49 - and it certainly shouldn't invol
141:51 - influence and it certain shouldn't
141:52 - involve lobbyists and all the [ __ ] that
141:54 - we know is a problem right now so if AI
141:57 - came along and said what you're doing
141:59 - right now is 70% corrupt here's why
142:02 - here's how here's how here's the
142:04 - long-term effects that it has over
142:06 - society as a whole uh the societal the
142:09 - the sociological aspects the
142:11 - psychological aspects distrust in
142:13 - government US versus them mentality
142:16 - government not working for you you
142:18 - working for the government you being
142:20 - scared of the government it's all
142:22 - because of people right like this is all
142:25 - corruption people bad
142:28 - influence and this is like this is what
142:31 - doge is essentially grappling with right
142:33 - now what happens when you let the people
142:34 - control it
142:37 - uh I mean it's it's people it's it's
142:39 - really just
142:42 - like computers that are like it's it's
142:46 - it's bad software and and computers like
142:49 - this is not kind of strange but it's
142:51 - like like the reason I call like tech
142:54 - support is is that a lot of it like it's
142:58 - it's mostly not corruption it's mostly
142:59 - just waste
143:01 - and and uh I don't know
143:05 - uh in competence I don't know it's just
143:08 - a big dumb machine basically like a
143:10 - whole series of of big dumb machines and
143:13 - and you you've got some of these
143:14 - computers are like 20 30 years like
143:16 - they're ancient computers like some of
143:18 - the software was written 40 50 years ago
143:20 - like coall for Social Security right
143:22 - yeah the government accountability by
143:24 - the way a bunch of the things that that
143:26 - doge is is fixing were identified by the
143:30 - government accountability office many
143:33 - years ago like the fact that there's
143:35 - like 20 million people who are marked as
143:39 - alive in the Social Security database uh
143:42 - it's more than the like I think the goo
143:45 - first identified that in 2018 so 5 years
143:48 - ago but there was like I think maybe 16
143:50 - or 17 million now there's 20 million and
143:52 - like I said there's really something
143:53 - fishy about this because I think they're
143:56 - the nature of the fraud is they're using
143:58 - the fact that someone's marked as live
143:59 - in that database in order to extract
144:01 - fraud from other databases right that's
144:03 - the that's the that's the bank shark
144:05 - trick you know it's like a PO it's like
144:07 - you know trying to get the the ball in
144:10 - in the in the hole Bank shut it off a
144:12 - bunch of things and then yeah um that's
144:15 - the bankshot sort of scam
144:19 - um so so
144:22 - um so we we're like doing Tex support
144:24 - we're like fixing stuff that is
144:27 - uh you know just broken um broken
144:32 - inefficient yeah poorly designed it's
144:34 - it's like talk about like this like FC
144:36 - stuff like it maybe it's in a computer
144:39 - somewhere but unless somebody unless
144:42 - somebody goes in like like unless I
144:43 - don't know if if like cash Bal can like
144:45 - log into his I his like FBI computer and
144:48 - say FY show me all this stuff you know
144:51 - and it shows up a file folder whatever
144:52 - have you talked to him about this uh no
144:55 - I
144:56 - mean I haven't but I I don't know if
145:00 - there's there's going to be some kind of
145:01 - computer system right uh they're like
145:04 - some of them are very very old computer
145:06 - systems
145:08 - um so it like might look like a bit of a
145:11 - relic but I assume it's it's uploaded
145:14 - somewhere it's like it's either in
145:15 - physical form or it's a computer thing
145:17 - but like unless somebody like let's say
145:19 - it's like it's in a computer but not one
145:21 - that you can access directly because
145:24 - it's hidden somewhere you know um well
145:26 - it would kind of have to be something
145:28 - like that
145:29 - right I don't know I mean what would
145:31 - they do with all those CH it's probably
145:32 - like not every like you wouldn't like
145:34 - they're not going to enable it such that
145:37 - anyone at the FBI could access it so
145:39 - there probably very few people so then
145:41 - it's not going to be it's it may be like
145:43 - a special computer that only a handful
145:45 - of people can access but then if none of
145:47 - those people tell cash where the
145:50 - computer is how's he going to find
145:53 - it Jesus
145:57 - Christ anyway so so like anyway we just
146:01 - uh yeah I don't know what has this
146:03 - experience been like for you as a person
146:06 - like to deal with all this hate and
146:09 - attack also have the responsibility of
146:12 - uh keeping Free Speech alive with X and
146:16 - just going into this insane pile of
146:23 - I
146:24 - mean I don't know it's pretty stressful
146:29 - actually
146:30 - um yeah these are real
146:33 - enemies like I think they they actually
146:35 - want to kill me and the reason I know
146:38 - well they they say so
146:40 - online you know there's like Reddit
146:43 - forums where they they don't just want
146:44 - to kill me they want to desecrate my
146:45 - cpse you
146:48 - know type of thing you know
146:51 - and what are they saying why what is the
146:54 - the
146:56 - primary
147:02 - um I mean I I I I think I think it's
147:06 - sort of just an antibody
147:09 - response
147:12 - uh I mean it's it's like that like like
147:15 - they're like well he's he he's a Nazi uh
147:18 - you know type of thing yeah and I'm like
147:20 - well I'm not a Nazi uh but if the Legacy
147:23 - Media is saying that I'm a Nazi and and
147:26 - that's all you read
147:29 - um then then that it's then you're kind
147:32 - of in like well he's Hitler we should
147:33 - assassinate Hitler shouldn't we like uh
147:36 - I mean that why was why did somebody why
147:38 - did that guy try to kill Trump and
147:40 - almost succeeded why did he do that well
147:43 - I'd like to know that well yeah but that
147:45 - that one's crazy you know the whole deal
147:48 - with that guy's house profession Ally
147:50 - scrubbed no footprint on the internet no
147:53 - social media
147:54 - footprint yeah there's 0% chance that he
147:57 - has no social media footprint he was in
147:59 - a Black Rock
148:03 - commercial do you think black black
148:05 - Rock's a bad company I don't think any
148:08 - company is a bad company I think their
148:11 - their design make much money as humanly
148:15 - possible and I think if you're trying to
148:18 - make as much money as humanly possible H
148:20 - you're going to do some things that
148:21 - aren't necessarily good the question is
148:24 - if you're going to have an assassination
148:26 - attempt on the president it's not like
148:28 - black Rock's board sits down and votes
148:31 - on it yeah no this that be awward you
148:34 - know the board minutes if you're like
148:35 - guys remember that time when we said we
148:38 - probably shouldn't have done that you I
148:39 - highly doubt it would be a corporation
148:42 - that chooses to do something like this I
148:44 - think more likely it's individuals
148:47 - involved that recognize that it's
148:50 - beneficial to them if he gets
148:52 - assassinated and so a small group of
148:55 - people carry something out and with this
148:59 - kid we don't know anything right and
149:02 - everyone stopped asking questions and
149:05 - there was never a formal report there
149:07 - was never press conferences where they
149:09 - detailed all the information we know
149:11 - currently and where the investigation
149:12 - stands at the moment what we know is you
149:15 - have a very young kid who was filmed was
149:19 - they knew he was there with a
149:22 - rangefinder a half an hour before the
149:25 - event you also know that CNN streamed it
149:28 - live which I do not believe they did for
149:31 - any other rally and certainly not for a
149:34 - rally that's in the middle of nowhere in
149:36 - Pennsylvania like there's a lot of weird
149:39 - [ __ ] the fact that they wouldn't let
149:42 - people be on that roof because the
149:44 - Secret Service lady said it was sloped
149:47 - and it was dangerous that's what she
149:48 - didn't want to have meanwhile the
149:50 - snipers that were on the other roof was
149:52 - a a steeper pitch it made no [ __ ]
149:56 - sense I totally agree it makes no sense
149:57 - in fact I went back to to Butler uh with
150:02 - President Trump you know before the
150:03 - election like you know sort of like the
150:06 - return to Butler alley and and I was on
150:08 - that stage and I'm looking at that roof
150:10 - and I'm
150:11 - like if I was a
150:13 - sniper my pole position my number one
150:17 - spot would be that roof yeah like it's
150:20 - it's like the best seat the best seat in
150:22 - the house yeah like why would you not no
150:25 - it's so obvious it's the best seat in
150:27 - the house if you want to be a sniper
150:28 - there isn't a better position it was
150:30 - pretty obvious that the idea was like if
150:33 - if we're saying that this is a
150:34 - coordinated assassination attempt and it
150:36 - very well could have been that's what
150:38 - you would do you'd have someone go up
150:40 - there he shoots the president you shoot
150:41 - him you got Lee Harvey oswal over again
150:44 - it's over it's all wrapped up nice and
150:46 - clean they assassinated him we never
150:48 - heard a peep about it don't have any
150:50 - idea they would concoct some sort of
150:52 - story he was radicalized by this or that
150:55 - or you know he was on medication who
150:57 - knows right and now you know you have a
151:00 - completely different presidential
151:01 - election you have a murder on live
151:03 - television yeah I mean something would
151:05 - have had to happen to radicalize that
151:07 - kid because he knew he was going to die
151:09 - like he was going to they're going to
151:10 - shoot him you know or he'd be in prison
151:12 - for life those are the two outcomes like
151:15 - it it it's game he was basically he he
151:17 - was a suicide assassin yeah like you're
151:20 - not thinking you're coming out of that
151:21 - alive or or or or he's not escaping
151:24 - there's no escape plan right unless he
151:27 - was told that they were going to let him
151:29 - escape and the goal was to just shoot
151:31 - him anyway and to tell him give him
151:34 - extra motivation to do it we're going to
151:36 - let you get up there we're going to let
151:38 - you take the shot and then you're going
151:39 - to
151:40 - disappear like I don't how I don't
151:43 - understand how he got on the roof I just
151:45 - don't understand that that doesn't make
151:47 - any sense and it wasn't like it was a
151:50 - roof that's so high no one could see him
151:52 - people saw him up there I mean people
151:54 - like basically random passers by were
151:56 - pointing out that there's there's a guy
151:58 - on the roof with a [ __ ] gun with a
152:00 - gun yes yeah it's not like he was so far
152:02 - away you couldn't tell he had a gun
152:03 - people saw him yeah the whole thing's
152:05 - completely insane yeah and you don't
152:08 - hear a goddamn thing about it it's like
152:11 - I'm almost more interested in that no I
152:14 - am more interested in that than I am the
152:15 - JFK files I agree cuz I feel like with
152:18 - the JFK files it's so long ago
152:22 - if you could prove now and did you see
152:25 - that there was some sort of uh there was
152:28 - some indications that there was a phone
152:31 - that had been traveling from outside the
152:33 - FBI offices in DC to saw where this kid
152:37 - lived right multiple times I mean the
152:40 - the the cell phone records would be very
152:42 - telling yeah you can see what cell
152:45 - phones were close to other cell phones
152:47 - well I think they got they found that
152:48 - like for the like the F Island they also
152:50 - the cell phone records were leaked so
152:52 - you can see the you you can see the you
152:54 - can see it's precise enough you can see
152:56 - people walking down a path on fine
152:58 - Island Jesus Christ yeah yeah that's how
153:02 - precise it is so I mean you're you're
153:06 - you're leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
153:07 - wherever you go with your cell phone
153:09 - yeah is just this kid had five phones
153:13 - that's the other thing that's a lot of
153:15 - phones it's a lot of phones for a
153:16 - 20-year-old kid the whole thing how's he
153:19 - even that's that's kind of expensive you
153:21 - know yeah where's he getting the money
153:23 - yeah well you know also it's like how
153:27 - did his house get professionally
153:28 - scrubbed didn't even have any silverware
153:30 - in his house there's nothing in there
153:32 - there silverware no nothing no Cutlery
153:35 - no Cutlery that's weird his house was
153:38 - scrubbed and they they also created his
153:41 - body like oh gone gone like that yeah
153:44 - bye cuz who knows what the [ __ ] they
153:47 - gave him to get him to think that he's
153:49 - going to be able to shoot Trump like
153:50 - climb up on there shoot him like I mean
153:54 - who knows what kind of psychotropic
153:55 - drugs you can put someone on and under
153:57 - the power of hypnosis and suggestion and
153:59 - yeah who [ __ ] knows I mean this is
154:01 - what Mk Ultra was all about this is what
154:04 - Jolly West was practicing in the 1960s
154:06 - they were they were doing that back then
154:09 - they did it I mean there was tons and
154:13 - tons of experiments using psychotropic
154:16 - drugs hypnosis mind control all sorts
154:19 - different methods of
154:21 - manipulation the Harvard LSD studies
154:23 - that made uh Ted kazinski I mean that's
154:28 - they' they've been doing that
154:30 - forever yeah where's that file where's
154:33 - the [ __ ] file on that kid whoever
154:37 - they almost did something doesn't add up
154:39 - like this they they should have those
154:43 - those phones should
154:45 - be should they'll tell you what's going
154:47 - on yeah um
154:51 - it's all [ __ ] I mean it's it's very
154:54 - it's very
154:55 - shady you know there this's there's
154:58 - obviously there's the second guy that
154:59 - that almost succeeded in in um Coming
155:02 - the golf course the golf course yeah and
155:04 - it was just like a little caress and
155:06 - stuck his gun barrel out the out the
155:08 - Hedge you know just been was a dumbass
155:11 - and stuck his gun barrel out the
155:15 - Hedge yeah
155:18 - um so so and then there've been other
155:21 - people that have been intercepted on
155:22 - their way to kill Trump you know so
155:25 - there's you know multiple assassins
155:27 - inbound at this point he's got like an
155:28 - army protecting him well this is also
155:30 - part of the problem with the mainstream
155:32 - media saying that he's Hitler when Joy
155:36 - Reed had that show before the election
155:37 - she was comparing him to melini show
155:39 - Stalin and Hitler she pulled it all out
155:43 - they're literally saying saying that
155:44 - like Trump is yeah worse than Hitler
155:46 - melini and Stalin
155:47 - combined I mean they tried everything
155:50 - this is they I think those guys killed
155:52 - 100 million people so Trump has killed
155:55 - zero people I think a real big impact
155:57 - was you coming on the podcast the day
155:59 - before the election I think that had a
156:01 - giant impact that plea to camera if you
156:05 - don't vote this time this might be the
156:07 - last time you get to vote Yes and I
156:09 - think the way you laid it out today it's
156:10 - a compelling argument and I know a lot
156:12 - of people don't want to hear that and
156:13 - they're up in their a little they got
156:15 - their blue panties in a bunch right now
156:17 - but you you got to stop thinking that
156:19 - way tricked you into thinking you're in
156:20 - a tribe they don't give a [ __ ] about you
156:22 - that's the tribe's not real you're not
156:24 - really in a tribe they're using the fact
156:27 - they've got you in a tribe to manipulate
156:28 - you so they can keep doing what they're
156:30 - doing right now which is siphoning off
156:32 - money having incredible power and the
156:34 - more power and more money and more
156:36 - control over you they have the better
156:38 - they can keep doing this and that's what
156:40 - they want yeah that's exactly right yeah
156:43 - and that's that's the big threat that
156:44 - this Administration poses that's a big
156:46 - threat that was essentially do has found
156:49 - the coffin where the vampire
156:51 - sleeps yeah there's a lot of vampires
156:54 - yeah I mean but the I me we're we're
156:57 - we're disturbing the we're disturbing
157:00 - the the the nest The Nest yeah we're
157:02 - we're kicking the hornet nest
157:04 - yeah like big
157:07 - time and I mean we're reprogramming The
157:10 - Matrix like success was never one of the
157:14 - possible outcomes as a KOB yashim Maru
157:17 - situation um
157:20 - if you're in the Matrix success was
157:22 - never possible the only way to achieve
157:25 - success is to reprogram the Matrix such
157:27 - that success is one of the possible
157:29 - outcomes that's what we're doing yeah we
157:33 - may or may not
157:35 - succeed well it's certainly a lot of fun
157:37 - to
157:38 - watch this is a very exciting time
157:41 - because nothing changes when
157:44 - administrations comeing into Power very
157:47 - little changes I mean you have changes
157:49 - in terms of policy and inflation goes up
157:51 - and there's a lot of different things
157:52 - but not like this like these are giant
157:56 - fundamental
157:58 - changes and you know you see the system
158:01 - screeching and wailing and you see the
158:02 - vampires run from the light but it's uh
158:07 - it's very exciting like as a
158:10 - person a citizen you know just gets up
158:13 - in the morning and checks the news like
158:14 - I do and gets on X and sees what's going
158:16 - on every day he like holy [ __ ]
158:20 - he said what he's going to five million
158:23 - bucks you could just become a citizen
158:24 - now he could clear the debt with 10
158:27 - million people I never thought of that
158:28 - like what 50 trillion you can make $50
158:31 - trillion that way and then we have 15
158:33 - trillion in the bank whoa well I mean
158:36 - our debt is way way bigger than that
158:38 - yeah the I mean that the debts uh I
158:41 - think over 30 trillion at this point
158:43 - yeah he said he could make 50 trillion
158:45 - if he sold 10 million uh new I don't I
158:49 - think there's that many people who have
158:51 - but yeah how many people do have that in
158:53 - the in the world maybe we' get the worst
158:55 - people in the world to come over here
158:57 - and I I think the assumption is if you
159:00 - have $5 million you have a lot to
159:01 - contribute come on over here start a
159:03 - business get something cracking yeah I
159:06 - mean you you'd get like a green card not
159:07 - citizenship so you actually if if you
159:10 - commit a crime while on a green card you
159:13 - lose you lose your green card is that
159:14 - what it is with this golden ticket is
159:16 - that a green card or is it citizenship
159:18 - just a green card yeah so you have to
159:21 - not commit any crime for 5 years in
159:22 - order to become a citizen once you
159:24 - commit a citizen you can commit you can
159:26 - then commit crime and not be
159:28 - deported so oh there's just so many wild
159:32 - things that he's proposing just the
159:34 - whole Gulf of America thing was
159:35 - hilarious I kind of I think that's great
159:37 - I think it's great it's fun yeah it's
159:39 - fun I mean if you're if you're off the
159:41 - coast of Houston you're not in Mexico so
159:43 - why call it Gulf of Mexico yeah yeah I
159:46 - agree yeah um I guess we're just being
159:49 - nice before like I don't know how it got
159:51 - called the go from Mexico it's just it's
159:55 - just very funny and then what what what
159:57 - what news organization was it AP yeah
159:59 - ap's there's this like massive standoff
160:03 - between AP and like the White House you
160:07 - know and the White House Press office I
160:09 - guess because they're like well if you
160:11 - don't call it Gulf of America you can't
160:13 - you can't come you can't come to the
160:15 - White House Press
160:18 - Room says then the aps like sued the
160:22 - White House to say like no you have to
160:24 - let us come to the White House Press
160:25 - room and then they lost their lawsuit
160:27 - because like you know there's not like
160:29 - they have a right right to show up at
160:31 - the Press Room well here's a
160:32 - consideration if you're guilty of
160:36 - massive amounts of misinformation and
160:38 - disinformation as a part of a propaganda
160:42 - campaign that's what AP is well a lot of
160:45 - them are guilty of it a lot of the
160:48 - people that are in that white house
160:49 - press conference a lot of the
160:50 - organizations they work for distributed
160:53 - absolute lies total lies how many of
160:57 - them during the whole Russia gate thing
160:59 - yes how I mean just that alone a ton of
161:01 - people think that that the the Russia
161:03 - thing was real Still Still Still and it
161:06 - was I mean the whole steel dossier where
161:08 - it was like completely concocted like
161:11 - fabricated by the Clinton campaign
161:13 - correct funed the Clinton campaign
161:15 - funded a fake conspiracy theory uh fake
161:19 - Russia collusion hoax uh regarding Trump
161:22 - that was completely false and they
161:24 - reiterated on television for three
161:26 - [ __ ] years yes yeah they also
161:29 - repeated the fine people hoax yeah that
161:31 - said that that uh Trump called Nazis
161:34 - fine neonazis fine people which is
161:37 - demonstrably false if you just listen to
161:39 - his speech he absolutely makes it clear
161:41 - that he does not think neo-nazis are
161:43 - fine people he literally said that I'm
161:46 - not talking about neo-nazis or white
161:48 - nationalists they should be condemned
161:50 - totally exactly in that speech and yet
161:52 - they repeated the that lie uh and I just
161:56 - completely lost respect for Obama when
161:58 - he repeated that light a few days before
162:00 - the election knowing it's false well
162:03 - this just shows how desperate they were
162:04 - to keep Trump out which is wild they
162:07 - would do anything yeah yeah and I think
162:11 - they just felt like this is a tool that
162:12 - we have and let's use it yeah let's just
162:15 - say whatever the [ __ ] we have say
162:17 - anything yeah now they using the Nazi
162:19 - thing on me obviously
162:22 - um yeah um but it is a little troubling
162:26 - because I mean obviously if if if people
162:28 - have fed non-stop propaganda it is like
162:30 - Mass hypnosis right you're going to
162:32 - reach some number of people who are you
162:35 - know uh homicidal um
162:39 - and and convince them that well if you
162:41 - kill this guy who's supposed to be like
162:43 - this terrible human then that's a good
162:46 - thing yeah um I mean this is l shooting
162:49 - the United Healthcare guy it's so don't
162:52 - understand that one frankly um but I
162:55 - mean you shouldn't
162:57 - like I don't get it yeah I don't get it
162:59 - either he didn't even have a contract
163:01 - with them it wasn't even like that was
163:02 - his provider and they [ __ ] him over
163:05 - yeah I'm like I don't know what maybe
163:07 - we'll find out in the trial I mean but
163:09 - still kind of crazy it is crazy but
163:12 - there are people like that out there and
163:14 - as to the point that we spoke about
163:16 - earlier it's only Fox News that's
163:18 - talking about the positive things that
163:20 - Doge has found only every other media
163:23 - organization is on this constant
163:26 - propaganda tour where they're only
163:28 - talking about the negative aspects that
163:31 - turn out to not even be true right it's
163:34 - crazy yeah I mean this uh Scott Jennings
163:36 - on CNN is good he's like oh my God he's
163:39 - great he's great it's like it's just
163:41 - funny watching speak logically to these
163:43 - people and they freak
163:44 - out yes it's it's it's remarkable it is
163:49 - it's and he's so calm when he does it
163:51 - yeah he's so good and it's crazy that
163:53 - they keep letting him do it because it's
163:54 - like he's just dunking on these people
163:56 - over and over and over again and they
163:57 - never score it's kind of funny totally I
164:00 - mean good kudos to them for uh having a
164:03 - legitimate conservative voice who's a
164:04 - reasonable person on these panels now
164:07 - but even then he's outmanned it's like
164:09 - one of him and there's a bunch of
164:12 - screechy you know woke people it's it's
164:15 - it's wild I mean they're just they're
164:17 - like I think we should still stay mostly
164:20 - woke like yeah that's what essentially
164:23 - what they're doing like our business was
164:24 - being hurt when we were all woke but
164:26 - let's stay mostly woke yeah that way
164:29 - they just backed it off a notch just a
164:31 - notch just a notch but it's so the
164:33 - problem is when you back it off a notch
164:35 - and you let someone like Scott Jennings
164:36 - in you like you're [ __ ] up your whole
164:38 - business because all the viral Clips are
164:41 - all him saying logical reasonable things
164:44 - with a calm tone and people screeching
164:47 - about diversity and equity and
164:50 - horeshit yes yeah he's like being
164:53 - logical and reasonable and they're just
164:55 - lobing a bunch of non seers that you
164:57 - know don't mean
164:59 - anything and um yeah the real trap in
165:01 - this country is a two-party system
165:03 - that's the real trap because people do
165:05 - believe it they do believe they're on
165:06 - the right side they do believe the other
165:08 - side's the wrong side if there was five
165:10 - six legitimate parties with varying
165:13 - positions on things and much more
165:14 - Centrist parties that were legitimate
165:16 - that people knew that if they voted for
165:18 - these people could get in and and enact
165:20 - legitimate change we'd be a lot better
165:22 - off but boy they put a lock down on that
165:25 - [ __ ] right after Ross perau came along
165:27 - Ross po perau [ __ ] everything up that
165:29 - election yeah Bill Clinton got in yeah
165:32 - and they were like that's it from now on
165:35 - no one's debating unless
165:37 - you're either the head of that party or
165:40 - that's it yeah you get you got to be
165:42 - like locked into the system we're not
165:45 - letting any wacka Doos in there yeah I
165:48 - remember watching those rbo videos oh
165:50 - like him on TV with his charts and
165:52 - everything oh yeah he was telling you
165:54 - how the IRS was [ __ ] you this is what
165:55 - the federal this is what Federal Reserve
165:57 - really is and you're like what I
165:59 - remember watching that the guy bought a
166:00 - whole half hour of television on prime
166:03 - time I remember it might have been an
166:04 - hour I remember watching that thing
166:06 - going how is this guy even allowed to do
166:08 - this this is this is crazy I think most
166:12 - of what he was saying was true yeah it
166:13 - is it's absolutely true it's absolutely
166:16 - true I mean he didn't lie he told the
166:18 - truth he just hit understood it in a way
166:19 - that the general public had literally no
166:22 - idea well I mean I think this there's
166:24 - also this you know like do we actually
166:26 - have two parties do we have one party
166:28 - like the whole unip party thing right
166:29 - it's kind of true so I mean my sort of
166:33 - rough guess is that
166:36 - while like I think
166:38 - maybe uh 3/4 of The graft is democratic
166:42 - I think there's like maybe I don't know
166:44 - 20 25% that's Republicans so they've
166:47 - like basically most of the graft is
166:50 - going to the Democrats but they throw
166:52 - they throw some bones to the Republicans
166:54 - too so they're in on it and you know
166:57 - it's not like there zero graph in the
166:58 - Republican side to clear oh there's
167:00 - plenty of conservative that are insider
167:03 - trading in Congress yeah plenty insider
167:06 - trading and and and just this The
167:08 - Curious Case of uh how how do people in
167:13 - you know Congress or whatever become
167:15 - wealthy over time um extremely wealthy
167:18 - yeah
167:19 - on a $170,000 a year salary it's like
167:22 - literally impossible yeah no one else
167:24 - does that it's literally impossible if
167:25 - you find out that this guy has a
167:27 - $170,000 a year job you're like oh he's
167:29 - he's doing okay he's all right yeah and
167:31 - then you're like wait a minute why does
167:32 - he have $50 million yes what is he doing
167:36 - correct yeah um and I think like the the
167:39 - more accurate thing would be to say like
167:41 - what is the what does the family value
167:44 - increase like mean meaning like um the
167:49 - how much does their spouse own do they
167:51 - have a mysteriously wealthy spouse
167:54 - right right this is or and do they have
167:58 - a spouse that's really good at insider
168:01 - trading
168:02 - yeah like Paul
168:05 - Pelosi really good yeah he's great at
168:07 - trading he's such a good Trader yeah so
168:11 - this
168:12 - it's I mean so yeah there's I mean
168:16 - that's why I actually posted on X like I
168:18 - think maybe we should pay politicians
168:21 - more frankly because it reduces the
168:24 - forcing function for graft you know uh
168:27 - like I I think maybe we should either
168:29 - pay politicians nothing or maybe a lot a
168:32 - lot more it's like somewhat maybe
168:36 - counterintuitively if if politicians got
168:38 - paid a lot more then they wouldn't they
168:40 - wouldn't feel like that there's so so
168:42 - much of a forcing function for them to
168:47 - uh accept Cor money yeah but the problem
168:49 - is if you PID them a lot more they're
168:51 - still not going to make as much money as
168:52 - they would inside of trading but it's
168:54 - less of a forcing function yes it's well
168:57 - let me put this like if you say like
168:59 - somebody's got a um let's say they got
169:01 - like whatever some some kids in DC and
169:04 - like it's expensive it's like expensive
169:07 - place to live they the the schools are
169:10 - terrible so like they need to send their
169:12 - kids to like some kind of private
169:13 - schooling situation they literally
169:15 - cannot afford
169:16 - that they cannot afford that right now
169:18 - now so then you get into the situation
169:20 - well from their standpoint well they've
169:23 - got to they'll say they're doing it for
169:26 - their family they're doing it for their
169:27 - kids well especially if it's legal and
169:29 - it currently is you kind of be silly to
169:32 - not do that if you were a part of a
169:34 - group of people that's passing a bill
169:36 - and you know this bill's going to get
169:37 - passed you know the votes are there and
169:40 - you know it's going to affect this
169:41 - industry and this particular
169:43 - manufacturer and you can buy
169:46 - stock it it's more than just in insider
169:49 - trading
169:51 - um like the insider trading stuff like
169:53 - the stock portfolio stuff is quite
169:55 - trackable but there's
169:58 - um it's a lot more than insider trading
170:01 - the way they're acquiring wealth correct
170:03 - and what other
170:05 - methods I mean this is really going to
170:07 - get me
170:09 - assassinated it's
170:11 - like I'm I'm not lengthening my lifespan
170:14 - by explaining this stuff to say the
170:17 - least um
170:19 - I mean I was supposed to go back to DC
170:21 - how am I going to
170:22 - survive fers is going to kill me for
170:25 - sure um so
170:29 - um in fact I I I do think like there's
170:32 - it's like I actually have to be careful
170:34 - that I don't push too hard on the
170:38 - corruption stuff because is going to get
170:41 - me
170:42 - killed
170:44 - um you know um
170:50 - yeah you
170:52 - know it's like I was actually thinking
170:54 - about that on the plane flight over here
170:55 - it's
170:56 - like P if I push too hard on the
170:58 - corruption stuff people get desperate is
171:01 - is the issue right then they say like
171:02 - okay if if the if the if the money flow
171:06 - cuts off then okay they can't afford
171:09 - school for their kids right then then
171:11 - it's then they're going like well [ __ ]
171:13 - you I'm going to kill you for my kids
171:16 - type of thing yeah you know then it's
171:17 - like oh jesz okay did you ever see that
171:20 - video I think it was a nokee video where
171:23 - um they've got this guy undercover and
171:26 - he's explaining they're talking to this
171:28 - guy who thinks he's on a date and he's
171:30 - explaining it's always a guy on a date
171:32 - yeah explaining how they can nudge
171:35 - someone to go and do something horrible
171:38 - and they they recognize this person has
171:40 - problems they re they find an asset yeah
171:44 - totally well see this is what I think
171:46 - like for that Butler situation for that
171:48 - assassin you you you don't it's kind of
171:51 - like uh that's that that the funny
171:54 - looking sport curling you know where
171:56 - they have like the stone on the ice and
171:58 - then they throw the stone and then
172:00 - there's someone with that's like
172:01 - brushing the ice but you can't you can't
172:04 - touch the stone right all you can do is
172:06 - just change the change the path of the
172:08 - stone a little bit but you keep brushing
172:10 - the ice and uh and you can steer that
172:13 - stone right into the
172:14 - bullseye that's that's what I think
172:17 - happened in Butler that's that's what I
172:19 - think happened with that assassin yeah
172:21 - if you can if you can find the
172:23 - trail of breadcrumbs it it's going to be
172:26 - like curling somebody was brushing the
172:28 - ice well also you find a young confused
172:31 - disenfranchised person and you give them
172:33 - purpose in their life just brush the ice
172:36 - yeah and also brushing the ice
172:37 - eventually it's going to hit the
172:38 - bullseye if you're in a position of
172:40 - authority you're some like BigTime
172:43 - government person you're talking to this
172:45 - all of a sudden this person's a valuable
172:47 - asset they're going to help America and
172:50 - you're going to do this thing and you're
172:52 - going to be our top Assassin from here
172:54 - on
172:56 - out you could talk people into doing a
172:58 - lot of things that's why Cults are
173:00 - around right no exactly yeah um I mean
173:04 - there suicide bombers I mean the the
173:06 - butler guy was a suicide assassin the
173:08 - the guy that the second guy that tried
173:10 - to kill him on the golf course was also
173:12 - a suicide assassin um from what I read
173:15 - the uh the secrets of M that that saw
173:20 - the gun pointing out it fired several
173:22 - shots none of which hit the Assassin but
173:25 - they could have like if those if if if
173:27 - those shots had hit the Second Assassin
173:30 - he would have he would be dead too so
173:32 - both of them were you know on a on
173:37 - a I mean they they were on a suicide
173:41 - mission both of them one one actually
173:44 - got killed the one one of them didn't
173:46 - get killed but he could have been killed
173:48 - if they did the bullets that hit him and
173:49 - you don't hear anything about him
173:51 - either there's there's a lot more about
173:53 - that guy than the first guy I mean you
173:55 - look at you look at his background he
173:57 - looks like uh you know unhinged yeah
174:01 - totally unhinged yeah the first guy
174:03 - there's there there's if there's no I'm
174:05 - not aware of any evidence that shows
174:07 - like that he's so unhinged as to be a
174:10 - suicide assassin no the second guy like
174:13 - okay yeah sure well two years before
174:14 - he's acting in
174:16 - commercials and he got got high high
174:19 - score in his SATs yeah so you know
174:27 - um well without getting you killed yeah
174:29 - exactly so I mean like basically I'm
174:32 - like
174:33 - listen we attack the corruption enough
174:37 - to keep civilization Trucking along you
174:39 - know yeah uh but but I think if I if I
174:43 - if I fully destroy the the the the the
174:48 - corruption and The graft they will kill
174:51 - me that's a [ __ ] up thing to live with
174:57 - yes so I'm like damn
175:00 - it listen I really hope they don't kill
175:03 - you yeah thanks um I mean I I strive
175:08 - strive to be alive um but uh yeah I mean
175:12 - it's it's a real concern
175:16 - um you know I mean the there were two
175:18 - guys that in before I supported Trump
175:21 - and everything uh there were two guys
175:24 - that traveled to auson to kill me I
175:27 - don't know if you know about this yeah I
175:29 - did hear about that yeah and and two
175:31 - separate
175:32 - incidents um one was going to one
175:35 - thought one guy thought i' put a chip in
175:36 - his head um and uh I mean they're both
175:40 - basically two guys that were just very
175:42 - much had severe mental illness it wasn't
175:45 - like they had like a I disagree with him
175:47 - politically and that's why he needs to
175:48 - die uh this is pre before I was uh this
175:52 - before I got sort of smeared as as being
175:56 - you know some sort of like Nazi or
175:58 - something like that there so before the
176:00 - propaganda wave the the severe
176:02 - propaganda wave
176:04 - um the the the probability that any
176:07 - given homicidal maniac is going to try
176:09 - to kill you is proportionate to how many
176:10 - times they hear your
176:12 - name and so they heard my name a lot so
176:15 - I just I just got to the top of the list
176:18 - of two homicidal Maniacs who were
176:20 - arrested and and and both were in Travis
176:23 - County Jail at the same time wow yeah I
176:27 - don't know if they talked or whatever
176:29 - but they've both been released by the
176:31 - way Jesus Christ both on fail
176:34 - yeah right they got they got ankle
176:36 - monitors and stuff but still they can
176:38 - cut those off yeah I don't know you know
176:41 - exactly
176:43 - so um that's crazy yeah and the second
176:47 - the second guy had like Chief serial
176:49 - killer in his bio on his X
176:51 - profile yeah it's like wasn't subtle is
176:54 - what I'm saying Jesus
176:56 - Christ
176:59 - yeah um and and and at this point I
177:03 - think I'm at the top of the list for a
177:05 - lot of homicidal
177:06 - maniacs and the more the mainstream
177:08 - media talks about you in this way yes
177:11 - and and says you're a Nazi
177:15 - and they're doing the same thing to me
177:17 - that they did to Trump yeah um which is
177:21 - they're making it sound like if you kill
177:23 - me you're a
177:24 - hero that's
177:27 - uh what they're doing is
177:30 - evil they're also doing the same thing
177:32 - where they're completely distorting who
177:34 - you are and people are going along with
177:36 - it and just like we're talking about
177:38 - Trump derangement syndrome people have
177:40 - Elon derangement syndrome I I see it see
177:42 - where people can't see the forest for
177:44 - the trees right and it's like I'm the
177:46 - same person that I was a year ago
177:49 - nothing's changed really um like I I I
177:54 - didn't suddenly become completely
177:56 - different human right um but if you read
177:59 - the if you read the sort of Legacy
178:01 - mainstream
178:03 - media the their propaganda stream is
178:06 - that I am a completely different human
178:08 - right but I didn't get like a brain
178:09 - transplant you know in a year so um and
178:14 - if you say like two years ago I was like
178:16 - a hero of the left yeah
178:19 - so how can I go from hero to
178:22 - Villain at age 53 suddenly MSNBC CNN
178:27 - yeah it's like that's what it is yeah
178:30 - they they use the ass propaganda mhm um
178:36 - yeah I mean they try to demonize you too
178:40 - yeah uh even tried to demonize in fact
178:44 - at least possibly successfully
178:46 - uh um demonized like Tim oin yeah who is
178:51 - a super rational reasonable great
178:53 - human and um and and then that like his
178:57 - Wikipedia changed to like far right yeah
179:02 - he's like far right I'm like what are
179:04 - you talking about yeah uh you know a
179:07 - like a few years ago he was like a
179:08 - liberal yeah so how did he go from Far
179:10 - Right liberal to like instantly far
179:12 - right and there's like there's no
179:13 - there's no left and right there's only
179:15 - left and far right right yeah
179:19 - even far right this is my left leg and
179:21 - this is my far right leg and even far
179:24 - left far left is sort of dismissed as
179:26 - being like not important to talk about
179:28 - like antifa and radical leftist that's
179:32 - not buring down couses yeah reasonable
179:36 - reasonable people yeah yeah totally
179:39 - crazy it's a crazy time and it's not a
179:41 - time that I ever anticipated I was going
179:42 - to witness this is far beyond anything I
179:45 - ever thought I was going to experience
179:48 - in the the the clarity of it all where
179:50 - it's it's so obvious yeah and the the
179:54 - the gaslighting and the propaganda is so
179:56 - obvious and I saw the shrieking when RFK
180:00 - Jr stopped this new test for new covid
180:04 - vaccines on children 10,000 they're
180:07 - going to do 10,000 people with this
180:08 - covid vaccine like who the [ __ ] thinks
180:11 - that's a good thing at this point not me
180:13 - what person what per what gas chamber
180:17 - like not gas light you're you are you
180:20 - are fully unconscious there's no
180:24 - way there's no way you know if you know
180:28 - the effect of covid today no one's dying
180:31 - of it this is not a pandemic anymore
180:33 - right the idea that you're going to run
180:35 - a [ __ ] huge test with 10,000 kids and
180:38 - a new vaccine like what are you even
180:40 - it's completely unnecessary totally
180:42 - unnecessary yes and shrieking when RFK
180:46 - Jr steps in to stop it
180:48 - yeah that's totally crazy um I mean I'm
180:53 - I'm like over I'm overall Pro vaccine
180:56 - meaning like like we think should have
180:57 - some reasonable number of vaccines
181:00 - against major
181:01 - ailments um but I don't think we should
181:03 - be like like jamming some you know
181:06 - little kid with like a giant file that's
181:09 - like Hepatitis B yeah 20 20 different
181:13 - things at a time it's like it's going to
181:15 - overload your it seems like it's there's
181:16 - a risk of overloading your IM imune
181:18 - system if you I mean there's like how
181:20 - many vaccines can you take at a time it
181:23 - seems like your systems there's like
181:24 - some risk of system overload here well
181:26 - there's two hopes hope number one is
181:29 - they can somehow or another stop this
181:33 - ability that they have to advertise on
181:35 - television if that happens that's big
181:38 - that's huge because that doesn't just
181:40 - stop their ability to show you all these
181:42 - different medications that you should be
181:45 - on what it also does is it stops their
181:48 - Financial influence on the news that's
181:50 - big yeah that's that's really the
181:52 - biggest thing is
181:53 - that I mean the the the news is not
181:56 - going to attack one of their biggest
181:59 - advertisers exactly and they never do
182:01 - yes at best they're GNA like they might
182:03 - like they'll they'll do something but
182:05 - it's they're going to pull their punches
182:07 - like they're going to they're going to
182:08 - be like like like fake fighting yeah
182:11 - yeah at best yes like movie fighting
182:13 - like they're not actually Landing
182:15 - Haymakers it just looks like it the next
182:16 - step then is to remove this immunity
182:21 - that these vaccine manufacturers have
182:24 - and if they are liable for side effects
182:27 - and they are liable for the lies that
182:29 - they tell when they do these studies and
182:30 - they hide negative data that'll change a
182:34 - lot yes
182:38 - um yeah
182:41 - um I think AI actually be very helpful
182:43 - with with medical
182:45 - stuff because AI can like look at you
182:48 - know all all the studies and look at all
182:49 - the data cross check everything and give
182:52 - you good
182:53 - recommendations I mean even as it is
182:55 - like right now you can upload like your
182:57 - X-rays and your MRI images to Gro and
182:59 - it'll give you a medical diagnosis and
183:02 - that diagnosis from what I've seen is at
183:04 - least as good as what if not I think
183:07 - I've seen certainly seen cases where
183:09 - it's actually better than what do do
183:11 - tell phenomenal for blood work yeah yeah
183:14 - I mean you can literally take a
183:16 - photograph of your blood work like the
183:18 - the page upload from your phone upload
183:22 - that to grock and it will tell you if
183:24 - there's if if it's it it'll it'll
183:27 - understand what what what what that what
183:30 - all the data results are and tell you if
183:33 - there's something wrong it's pretty
183:35 - amazing yeah and it's I haven't seen it
183:37 - be wrong
183:39 - yet well supposedly more accurate than
183:42 - most Physicians yeah cuz Physicians are
183:45 - human beings and maybe they don't have
183:47 - deep understanding of the connection
183:49 - between oh you have this deficiency and
183:52 - this is high and your cortisol is here
183:54 - and well yeah and like so you know
183:56 - sometimes doctors especially in high
183:58 - rent offices will uh sell you stuff you
184:00 - don't need um so you I always like to be
184:03 - a little suspicious of like a doctor
184:05 - that's got an office in Beverly Hills
184:07 - it's a high R situation like I'm not
184:09 - saying there are some very good doctors
184:10 - in Beverly Hills High rent situation
184:13 - yeah um you're at least tempted by the
184:15 - dark side yeah and I mean one case like
184:19 - I you know got this went to this doctor
184:20 - who was like highly recommended you know
184:23 - doctor to the Stars which is like maybe
184:25 - not a good sign um and uh I I got like
184:29 - blood work done you know like just just
184:33 - Dre blood and sent it to a lab and and
184:36 - and the guy I'm like sitting in his
184:38 - office and he tells me that I'm like
184:40 - like B12 deficient you know it's
184:42 - certainly possible that I'm B12
184:44 - deficient and I was like huh okay and
184:46 - then he gives me it says like you have
184:47 - to take these like B12 supplements from
184:50 - and and he he's going to give me a
184:51 - starter pack you know and then it's
184:53 - going to be like $1,000 a month for
184:55 - these special B12 $1,000 a month of B12
184:58 - ridiculous amount of money yeah that's
184:59 - CRA you get it on
185:01 - Amazon yeah but his one's special oh
185:03 - special B12 yeah um yeah it was like
185:07 - like a a whole bunch B12 and a whole
185:09 - bunch of other vitamins so then I'm I I
185:11 - get home like I'm paging through my
185:13 - blood work and it says I have uh
185:15 - according to the blood results I have XS
185:18 - B12 so I'm like wait a
185:21 - second and he's giving me box pulls that
185:24 - have like
185:26 - 20,000% uh of of recommended daily dose
185:29 - like 20,000% is a lot big number and I'm
185:32 - like I said look I took a photograph of
185:35 - the blood work that says I have excess
185:37 - I'm like above the range above the
185:39 - recommended range of B12 and then I'm
185:41 - like and I took picture of things says
185:43 - of the the pulls that say
185:46 - 20,000% I was like can you help me
185:49 - reconcile these two things because it
185:51 - says I've got too much little too much
185:53 - V12 and you just gave me pills that have
185:55 - 20,000% more I'm like this is crazy what
185:59 - did the doctor say he said you can never
186:01 - have too much
186:02 - B12 oh he's he's a psychopath yes that
186:06 - guy's a B12 addict yeah it's totally
186:09 - insane that's what I'm saying it's
186:12 - like so I mean I could have just so then
186:15 - you know well this was a while ago right
186:17 - so this is pre like 5 years ago yeah
186:19 - right this is pre grock like now you
186:21 - could just enter in all that data and gr
186:24 - just photograph with your phone and
186:26 - upload it to Gro and it tells Gro will
186:27 - tell you what's uh what's if just don't
186:30 - have it in sexy mode she'll keep trying
186:32 - to [ __ ]
186:33 - [Applause]
186:35 - you I mean you're asking for it in sexy
186:37 - mode you know literally you tapped on
186:40 - sexy
186:41 - mode I mean I think we probably should
186:43 - like maybe allow it to get out of
186:46 - character a little bit sure yeah it's
186:49 - like in unhinged mode I tried to get it
186:51 - back to being hinged but it would like
186:52 - no [ __ ] way it's like I'm going to
186:55 - stay UNH how many modes do you have I
186:57 - there's like I don't know like eight or
186:59 - something and then this there's an
187:01 - ability to have a custom mode um so then
187:05 - you could have unhinged Sexy O that's
187:09 - that's my favorite
187:11 - kind you may think
187:16 - so careful what you wish for be careful
187:19 - what you wish for especially if it's a
187:20 - robot and she can kill you UNH sexy
187:23 - robot is it's like
187:26 - dangerous remember like the Pink Panther
187:29 - remember Pink Panther had KO try to jump
187:31 - him they like keep them sharp I always
187:33 - trying to attack him remember that
187:37 - right listen man thank you for being
187:40 - here I always appreciate talking to you
187:41 - I know you're busy as [ __ ] so it means a
187:43 - lot to me that you have the time to do
187:45 - this and uh I think what you're doing is
187:48 - one of the most important things that
187:49 - has ever happened in this country I
187:51 - really do and particularly with the
187:53 - ownership of X but also with what's
187:55 - happening with Doge and just
187:57 - enlightening all these people and
187:59 - Shining Light on all the vampires well
188:02 - hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi
188:04 - I think they I just want to be clear I
188:06 - am not a Nazi I think we covered it but
188:09 - that's exactly what a Nazi would say
188:10 - damn
188:11 - it yeah that's what an alien would say
188:14 - yeah there's like this you can't escape
188:16 - this [ __ ] no you can't escape it so
188:19 - I don't think any reasonable person
188:20 - believes it if they believe it it's cuz
188:21 - they want to believe it it's not because
188:23 - it's logical I mean what's relevant
188:25 - about Nazis is like are you like
188:26 - invading Poland okay um and if you're
188:28 - not if you're not like invading Poland
188:32 - maybe you're not yeah like you have to
188:34 - be like committing genocide and like
188:37 - starting Wars and if if you're if you're
188:39 - if you're not like what is actually what
188:42 - is bad about Nazis it's not their wasn't
188:44 - their fashion sense or their mannerisms
188:48 - it the Holocaust it was the the war and
188:51 - genocide is what is the bad part um not
188:55 - their mannerisms and their dress code
188:57 - well that was a problem with all that
188:59 - punch a Nazi [ __ ] like punch a Nazi
189:01 - remember that people were say that was
189:03 - like a thing that people kept saying
189:04 - punch a Nazi punch Nazis but he where

189:09 - [ __ ] Nazi I've never met one I've
189:10 - never run into a bunch of Nazis where I
189:12 - had to punch them well and what what
189:14 - about like all these like so-called like
189:16 - like proud boy rallies or whatever and
189:18 - and it's like they always got the masks

189:24 - right right right right wait we're
189:25 - always going to dox them except these
189:29 - guys great video of me and Matt Tai
